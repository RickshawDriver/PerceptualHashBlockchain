"As U.S. budget fight looms, Republicans flip their fiscal script","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of a conservative Republican faction in the U.S. Congress, who voted this month for a huge expansion of the national debt to pay for tax cuts, called himself a â€œfiscal conservativeâ€ on Sunday and urged budget restraint in 2018. In keeping with a sharp pivot under way among Republicans, U.S. Representative Mark Meadows, speaking on CBSâ€™ â€œFace the Nation,â€ drew a hard line on federal spending, which lawmakers are bracing to do battle over in January. When they return from the holidays on Wednesday, lawmakers will begin trying to pass a federal budget in a fight likely to be linked to other issues, such as immigration policy, even as the November congressional election campaigns approach in which Republicans will seek to keep control of Congress. President Donald Trump and his Republicans want a big budget increase in military spending, while Democrats also want proportional increases for non-defense â€œdiscretionaryâ€ spending on programs that support education, scientific research, infrastructure, public health and environmental protection. â€œThe (Trump) administration has already been willing to say: â€˜Weâ€™re going to increase non-defense discretionary spending ... by about 7 percent,â€™â€ Meadows, chairman of the small but influential House Freedom Caucus, said on the program. â€œNow, Democrats are saying thatâ€™s not enough, we need to give the government a pay raise of 10 to 11 percent. For a fiscal conservative, I donâ€™t see where the rationale is. ... Eventually you run out of other peopleâ€™s money,â€ he said. Meadows was among Republicans who voted in late December for their partyâ€™s debt-financed tax overhaul, which is expected to balloon the federal budget deficit and add about $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion national debt. â€œItâ€™s interesting to hear Mark talk about fiscal responsibility,â€ Democratic U.S. Representative Joseph Crowley said on CBS. Crowley said the Republican tax bill would require the  United States to borrow $1.5 trillion, to be paid off by future generations, to finance tax cuts for corporations and the rich. â€œThis is one of the least ... fiscally responsible bills weâ€™ve ever seen passed in the history of the House of Representatives. I think weâ€™re going to be paying for this for many, many years to come,â€ Crowley said. Republicans insist the tax package, the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in more than 30 years,  will boost the economy and job growth. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who also supported the tax bill, recently went further than Meadows, making clear in a radio interview that welfare or â€œentitlement reform,â€ as the party often calls it, would be a top Republican priority in 2018. In Republican parlance, â€œentitlementâ€ programs mean food stamps, housing assistance, Medicare and Medicaid health insurance for the elderly, poor and disabled, as well as other programs created by Washington to assist the needy. Democrats seized on Ryanâ€™s early December remarks, saying they showed Republicans would try to pay for their tax overhaul by seeking spending cuts for social programs. But the goals of House Republicans may have to take a back seat to the Senate, where the votes of some Democrats will be needed to approve a budget and prevent a government shutdown. Democrats will use their leverage in the Senate, which Republicans narrowly control, to defend both discretionary non-defense programs and social spending, while tackling the issue of the â€œDreamers,â€ people brought illegally to the country as children. Trump in September put a March 2018 expiration date on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which protects the young immigrants from deportation and provides them with work permits. The president has said in recent Twitter messages he wants funding for his proposed Mexican border wall and other immigration law changes in exchange for agreeing to help the Dreamers. Representative Debbie Dingell told CBS she did not favor linking that issue to other policy objectives, such as wall funding. â€œWe need to do DACA clean,â€ she said.  On Wednesday, Trump aides will meet with congressional leaders to discuss those issues. That will be followed by a weekend of strategy sessions for Trump and Republican leaders on Jan. 6 and 7, the White House said. Trump was also scheduled to meet on Sunday with Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott, who wants more emergency aid. The House has passed an $81 billion aid package after hurricanes in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico, and wildfires in California. The package far exceeded the $44 billion requested by the Trump administration. The Senate has not yet voted on the aid. ",politicsNews,"December 31, 2017 ",Real
U.S. military to accept transgender recruits on Monday: Pentagon,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Transgender people will be allowed for the first time to enlist in the U.S. military starting on Monday as ordered by federal courts, the Pentagon said on Friday, after President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration decided not to appeal rulings that blocked his transgender ban. Two federal appeals courts, one in Washington and one in Virginia, last week rejected the administrationâ€™s request to put on hold orders by lower court judges requiring the military to begin accepting transgender recruits on Jan. 1. A Justice Department official said the administration will not challenge those rulings. â€œThe Department of Defense has announced that it will be releasing an independent study of these issues in the coming weeks. So rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs, the administration has decided to wait for DODâ€™s study and will continue to defend the presidentâ€™s lawful authority in District Court in the meantime,â€ the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. In September, the Pentagon said it had created a panel of senior officials to study how to implement a directive by Trump to prohibit transgender individuals from serving. The Defense Department has until Feb. 21 to submit a plan to Trump. Lawyers representing currently-serving transgender service members and aspiring recruits said they had expected the administration to appeal the rulings to the conservative-majority Supreme Court, but were hoping that would not happen. Pentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb said in a statement: â€œAs mandated by court order, the Department of Defense is prepared to begin accessing transgender applicants for military service Jan. 1. All applicants must meet all accession standards.â€ Jennifer Levi, a lawyer with gay, lesbian and transgender advocacy group GLAD, called the decision not to appeal â€œgreat news.â€ â€œIâ€™m hoping it means the government has come to see that there is no way to justify a ban and that itâ€™s not good for the military or our country,â€ Levi said. Both GLAD and the American Civil Liberties Union represent plaintiffs in the lawsuits filed against the administration. In a move that appealed to his hard-line conservative supporters, Trump announced in July that he would prohibit transgender people from serving in the military, reversing Democratic President Barack Obamaâ€™s policy of accepting them. Trump said on Twitter at the time that the military â€œcannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.â€ Four federal judges - in Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Seattle and Riverside, California - have issued rulings blocking Trumpâ€™s ban while legal challenges to the Republican presidentâ€™s policy proceed. The judges said the ban would likely violate the right under the U.S. Constitution to equal protection under the law. The Pentagon on Dec. 8 issued guidelines to recruitment personnel in order to enlist transgender applicants by Jan. 1. The memo outlined medical requirements and specified how the applicantsâ€™ sex would be identified and even which undergarments they would wear. The Trump administration previously said in legal papers that the armed forces were not prepared to train thousands of personnel on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants and might have to accept â€œsome individuals who are not medically fit for service.â€ The Obama administration had set a deadline of July 1, 2017, to begin accepting transgender recruits. But Trumpâ€™s defense secretary, James Mattis, postponed that date to Jan. 1, 2018, which the presidentâ€™s ban then put off indefinitely. Trump has taken other steps aimed at rolling back transgender rights. In October, his administration said a federal law banning gender-based workplace discrimination does not protect transgender employees, reversing another Obama-era position. In February, Trump rescinded guidance issued by the Obama administration saying that public schools should allow transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity.

Senior U.S. Republican senator: 'Let Mr. Mueller do his job',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The special counsel investigation of links between Russia and President Trumpâ€™s 2016 election campaign should continue without interference in 2018, despite calls from some Trump administration allies and Republican lawmakers to shut it down, a prominent Republican senator said on Sunday. Lindsey Graham, who serves on the Senate armed forces and judiciary committees, said Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller needs to carry on with his Russia investigation without political interference. â€œThis investigation will go forward. It will be an investigation conducted without political influence,â€ Graham said on CBSâ€™s Face the Nation news program. â€œAnd we all need to let Mr. Mueller do his job. I think heâ€™s the right guy at the right time.â€  The question of how Russia may have interfered in the election, and how Trumpâ€™s campaign may have had links with or co-ordinated any such effort, has loomed over the White House since Trump took office in January. It shows no sign of receding as Trump prepares for his second year in power, despite intensified rhetoric from some Trump allies in recent weeks accusing Muellerâ€™s team of bias against the Republican president. Trump himself seemed to undercut his supporters in an interview last week with the New York Times in which he said he expected Mueller was â€œgoing to be fair.â€    Russiaâ€™s role in the election and the question of possible links to the Trump campaign are the focus of multiple inquiries in Washington. Three committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives are investigating, as well as Mueller, whose team in May took over an earlier probe launched by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Several members of the Trump campaign and administration have been convicted or indicted in the investigation.  Trump and his allies deny any collusion with Russia during the campaign, and the Kremlin has denied meddling in the election. Graham said he still wants an examination of the FBIâ€™s use of a dossier on links between Trump and Russia that was compiled by a former British spy, Christopher Steele, which prompted Trump allies and some Republicans to question Muellerâ€™s inquiry.   On Saturday, the New York Times reported that it was not that dossier that triggered an early FBI probe, but a tip from former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos to an Australian diplomat that Russia had damaging information about former Trump rival Hillary Clinton.  â€œI want somebody to look at the way the Department of Justice used this dossier. It bothers me greatly the way they used it, and I want somebody to look at it,â€ Graham said. But he said the Russia investigation must continue. â€œAs a matter of fact, it would hurt us if we ignored it,â€ he said. ",politicsNews,"December 31, 2017 ",Real
FBI Russia probe helped by Australian diplomat tip-off: NYT,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos told an Australian diplomat in May 2016 that Russia had political dirt on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, the New York Times reported on Saturday. The conversation between Papadopoulos and the diplomat, Alexander Downer, in London was a driving factor behind the FBIâ€™s decision to open a counter-intelligence investigation of Moscowâ€™s contacts with the Trump campaign, the Times reported. Two months after the meeting, Australian officials passed the information that came from Papadopoulos to their American counterparts when leaked Democratic emails began appearing online, according to the newspaper, which cited four current and former U.S. and foreign officials. Besides the information from the Australians, the probe by the Federal Bureau of Investigation was also propelled by intelligence from other friendly governments, including the British and Dutch, the Times said. Papadopoulos, a Chicago-based international energy lawyer, pleaded guilty on Oct. 30 to lying to FBI agents about contacts with people who claimed to have ties to top Russian officials. It was the first criminal charge alleging links between the Trump campaign and Russia. The White House has played down the former aideâ€™s campaign role, saying it was â€œextremely limitedâ€ and that any actions he took would have been on his own. The New York Times, however, reported that Papadopoulos helped set up a meeting between then-candidate Donald Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and edited the outline of Trumpâ€™s first major foreign policy speech in April 2016. The federal investigation, which is now being led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, has hung over Trumpâ€™s White House since he took office almost a year ago. Some Trump allies have recently accused Muellerâ€™s team of being biased against the Republican president. Lawyers for Papadopoulos did not immediately respond to requests by Reuters for comment. Muellerâ€™s office declined to comment. Trumpâ€™s White House attorney, Ty Cobb, declined to comment on the New York Times report. â€œOut of respect for the special counsel and his process, we are not commenting on matters such as this,â€ he said in a statement. Mueller has charged four Trump associates, including Papadopoulos, in his investigation. Russia has denied interfering in the U.S. election and Trump has said there was no collusion between his campaign and Moscow. ",politicsNews,"December 30, 2017 ",Real
Trump wants Postal Service to charge 'much more' for Amazon shipments,"SEATTLE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump called on the U.S. Postal Service on Friday to charge â€œmuch moreâ€ to ship packages for Amazon (AMZN.O), picking another fight with an online retail giant he has criticized in the past.     â€œWhy is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging MUCH MORE!â€ Trump wrote on Twitter.  The presidentâ€™s tweet drew fresh attention to the fragile finances of the Postal Service at a time when tens of millions of parcels have just been shipped all over the country for the holiday season.  The U.S. Postal Service, which runs at a big loss, is an independent agency within the federal government and does not receive tax dollars for operating expenses, according to its website.  Package delivery has become an increasingly important part of its business as the Internet has led to a sharp decline in the amount of first-class letters. The president does not determine postal rates. They are set by the Postal Regulatory Commission, an independent government agency with commissioners selected by the president from both political parties. That panel raised prices on packages by almost 2 percent in November.  Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos, who remains the chief executive officer of the retail company and is the richest person in the world, according to Bloomberg News. Bezos also owns The Washington Post, a newspaper Trump has repeatedly railed against in his criticisms of the news media. In tweets over the past year, Trump has said the â€œAmazon Washington Postâ€ fabricated stories. He has said Amazon does not pay sales tax, which is not true, and so hurts other retailers, part of a pattern by the former businessman and reality television host of periodically turning his ire on big American companies since he took office in January. Daniel Ives, a research analyst at GBH Insights, said Trumpâ€™s comment could be taken as a warning to the retail giant. However, he said he was not concerned for Amazon. â€œWe do not see any price hikes in the future. However, that is a risk that Amazon is clearly aware of and (it) is building out its distribution (system) aggressively,â€ he said. Amazon has shown interest in the past in shifting into its own delivery service, including testing drones for deliveries. In 2015, the company spent $11.5 billion on shipping, 46 percent of its total operating expenses that year.  Amazon shares were down 0.86 percent to $1,175.90 by early afternoon. Overall, U.S. stock prices were down slightly on Friday.  Satish Jindel, president of ShipMatrix Inc, which analyzes shipping data, disputed the idea that the Postal Service charges less than United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N), the other biggest players in the parcel delivery business in the United States. Many customers get lower rates from UPS and FedEx than they would get from the post office for comparable services, he said. The Postal Service delivers about 62 percent of Amazon packages, for about 3.5 to 4 million a day during the current peak year-end holiday shipping season, Jindel said. The Seattle-based company and the post office have an agreement in which mail carriers take Amazon packages on the last leg of their journeys, from post offices to customersâ€™ doorsteps. Amazonâ€™s No. 2 carrier is UPS, at 21 percent, and FedEx is third, with 8 percent or so, according to Jindel. Trumpâ€™s comment tapped into a debate over whether Postal Service pricing has kept pace with the rise of e-commerce, which has flooded the mail with small packages.Private companies like UPS have long claimed the current system unfairly undercuts their business. Steve Gaut, a spokesman for UPS, noted that the company values its â€œproductive relationshipâ€ with the postal service, but that it has filed with the Postal Regulatory Commission its concerns about the postal serviceâ€™s methods for covering costs. Representatives for Amazon, the White House, the U.S. Postal Service and FedEx declined comment or were not immediately available for comment on Trumpâ€™s tweet. According to its annual report, the Postal Service lost $2.74 billion this year, and its deficit has ballooned to $61.86 billion.  While the Postal Serviceâ€™s revenue for first class mail, marketing mail and periodicals is flat or declining, revenue from package delivery is up 44 percent since 2014 to $19.5 billion in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2017. But it also lost about $2 billion in revenue when a temporary surcharge expired in April 2016. According to a Government Accountability Office report in February, the service is facing growing personnel expenses, particularly $73.4 billion in unfunded pension and benefits liabilities. The Postal Service has not announced any plans to cut costs. By law, the Postal Service has to set prices for package delivery to cover the costs attributable to that service. But the postal service allocates only 5.5 percent of its total costs to its business of shipping packages even though that line of business is 28 percent of its total revenue.

"White House, Congress prepare for talks on spending, immigration","WEST PALM BEACH, Fla./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House said on Friday it was set to kick off talks next week with Republican and Democratic congressional leaders on immigration policy, government spending and other issues that need to be wrapped up early in the new year. The expected flurry of legislative activity comes as Republicans and Democrats begin to set the stage for midterm congressional elections in November. President Donald Trumpâ€™s Republican Party is eager to maintain control of Congress while Democrats look for openings to wrest seats away in the Senate and the House of Representatives. On Wednesday, Trumpâ€™s budget chief Mick Mulvaney and legislative affairs director Marc Short will meet with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan - both Republicans - and their Democratic counterparts, Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi, the White House said. That will be followed up with a weekend of strategy sessions for Trump, McConnell and Ryan on Jan. 6 and 7 at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland, according to the White House. The Senate returns to work on Jan. 3 and the House on Jan. 8. Congress passed a short-term government funding bill last week before taking its Christmas break, but needs to come to an agreement on defense spending and various domestic programs by Jan. 19, or the government will shut down. Also on the agenda for lawmakers is disaster aid for people hit by hurricanes in Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida, and by wildfires in California. The House passed an $81 billion package in December, which the Senate did not take up. The White House has asked for a smaller figure, $44 billion. Deadlines also loom for soon-to-expire protections for young adult immigrants who entered the country illegally as children, known as â€œDreamers.â€ In September, Trump ended Democratic former President Barack Obamaâ€™s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which protected Dreamers from deportation and provided work permits, effective in March, giving Congress until then to devise a long-term solution. Democrats, some Republicans and a number of large companies have pushed for DACA protections to continue. Trump and other Republicans have said that will not happen without Congress approving broader immigration policy changes and tougher border security. Democrats oppose funding for a wall promised by Trump along the U.S.-Mexican border.  â€œThe Democrats have been told, and fully understand, that there can be no DACA without the desperately needed WALL at the Southern Border and an END to the horrible Chain Migration & ridiculous Lottery System of Immigration etc,â€ Trump said in a Twitter post on Friday. Trump wants to overhaul immigration rules for extended families and others seeking to live in the United States. Republican U.S. Senator Jeff Flake, a frequent critic of the president, said he would work with Trump to protect Dreamers. â€œWe can fix DACA in a way that beefs up border security, stops chain migration for the DREAMers, and addresses the unfairness of the diversity lottery. If POTUS (Trump) wants to protect these kids, we want to help him keep that promise,â€ Flake wrote on Twitter. Congress in early 2018 also must raise the U.S. debt ceiling to avoid a government default. The U.S. Treasury would exhaust all of its borrowing options and run dry of cash to pay its bills by late March or early April if Congress does not raise the debt ceiling before then, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Trump, who won his first major legislative victory with the passage of a major tax overhaul this month, has also promised a major infrastructure plan. ",politicsNews,"December 29, 2017 ",Real
"Trump says Russia probe will be fair, but timeline unclear: NYT","WEST PALM BEACH, Fla (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Thursday he believes he will be fairly treated in a special counsel investigation into Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential election, but said he did not know how long the probe would last. The federal investigation has hung over Trumpâ€™s White House since he took office almost a year ago, and some Trump allies have in recent weeks accused the team of Justice Department Special Counsel Robert Mueller of being biased against the Republican president. But in an interview with the New York Times, Trump appeared to shrug off concerns about the investigation, which was prompted by U.S. intelligence agenciesâ€™ conclusion that Russia tried to help Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton by hacking and releasing embarrassing emails and disseminating propaganda. â€œThereâ€™s been no collusion. But I think heâ€™s going to be fair,â€ Trump said in what the Times described as a 30-minute impromptu interview at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida. Mueller has charged four Trump associates in his investigation. Russia has denied interfering in the U.S. election. U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said this month that he was not aware of any impropriety by Muellerâ€™s team. Trumpâ€™s lawyers have been saying for weeks that they had expected the Mueller investigation to wrap up quickly, possibly by the end of 2017. Mueller has not commented on how long it will last. Trump told the Times that he did not know how long the investigation would take. â€œTiming-wise, I canâ€™t tell you. I just donâ€™t know,â€ he said. Trump said he thought a prolonged probe â€œmakes the country look badâ€ but said it has energized his core supporters. â€œWhat itâ€™s done is, itâ€™s really angered the base and made the base stronger. My base is strong than itâ€™s ever been,â€ he said. The interview was a rare break in Trumpâ€™s Christmas vacation in Florida. He has golfed each day aside from Christmas Day, and mainly kept a low profile, apart from the occasional flurry of tweets. He spent one day golfing with Republican Senator David Perdue from Georgia, who has pushed legislation to cap immigration numbers, and had dinner on Thursday with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, an international trade hawk. Trump told the Times he hoped to work with Democrats in the U.S. Congress on a spending plan to fix roads and other infrastructure, and on protections for a group of undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. Trump spoke about trade issues, saying he had backed off his hard line on Chinese trade practices in the hope that Beijing would do more to pressure North Korea to end its nuclear and missile testing program. He said he had been disappointed in the results. He also complained about the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which his administration is attempting to renegotiate in talks with Mexico and Canada. Trump said Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had played down the importance of Canadian oil and lumber exports to the United States when looking at the balance of trade between the two countries. â€œIf I donâ€™t make the right deal, Iâ€™ll terminate NAFTA in two seconds. But weâ€™re doing pretty good,â€ Trump said. ",politicsNews,"December 29, 2017 ",Real

Jones certified U.S. Senate winner despite Moore challenge,"(Reuters) - Alabama officials on Thursday certified Democrat Doug Jones the winner of the stateâ€™s U.S. Senate race, after a state judge denied a challenge by Republican Roy Moore, whose campaign was derailed by accusations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls. Jones won the vacant seat by about 22,000 votes, or 1.6 percentage points, election officials said. That made him the first Democrat in a quarter of a century to win a Senate seat in Alabama.  The seat was previously held by Republican Jeff Sessions, who was tapped by U.S. President Donald Trump as attorney general. A state canvassing board composed of Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill, Governor Kay Ivey and Attorney General Steve Marshall certified the election results. Seating Jones will narrow the Republican majority in the Senate to 51 of 100 seats. In a statement, Jones called his victory â€œa new chapterâ€ and pledged to work with both parties. Moore declined to concede defeat even after Trump urged him to do so. He stood by claims of a fraudulent election in a statement released after the certification and said he had no regrets, media outlets reported. An Alabama judge denied Mooreâ€™s request to block certification of the results of the Dec. 12 election in a decision shortly before the canvassing board met. Mooreâ€™s challenge alleged there had been potential voter fraud that denied him a chance of victory. His filing on Wednesday in the Montgomery Circuit Court sought to halt the meeting scheduled to ratify Jonesâ€™ win on Thursday. Moore could ask for a recount, in addition to possible other court challenges, Merrill said in an interview with Fox News Channel. He would have to complete paperwork â€œwithin a timed periodâ€ and show he has the money for a challenge, Merrill said. â€œWeâ€™ve not been notified yet of their intention to do that,â€ Merrill said. Regarding the claim of voter fraud, Merrill told CNN that more than 100 cases had been reported. â€œWeâ€™ve adjudicated more than 60 of those. We will continue to do that,â€ he said.  Republican lawmakers in Washington had distanced themselves from Moore and called for him to drop out of the race after several women accused him of sexual assault or misconduct dating back to when they were teenagers and he was in his early 30s.  Moore has denied wrongdoing and Reuters has not been able to independently verify the allegations. ",politicsNews,"December 28, 2017 ",Real
New York governor questions the constitutionality of federal tax overhaul,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The new U.S. tax code targets high-tax states and may be unconstitutional, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Thursday, saying that the bill may violate New York residentsâ€™ rights to due process and equal protection.  The sweeping Republican tax bill signed into law by U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday introduces a cap, of $10,000,  on deductions of state and local income and property taxes, known as SALT. The tax overhaul was the partyâ€™s first major legislative victory since Trump took office in January.  The SALT provision will hit many taxpayers in states with high incomes, high property values and high taxes, like New York, New Jersey and California. Those states are generally Democratic leaning.  â€œIâ€™m not even sure what they did is legally constitutional and thatâ€™s something weâ€™re looking at now,â€ Cuomo said in an interview with CNN. In an interview with CNBC, Cuomo suggested why the bill may be unconstitutional.  â€œPolitics does not trump the law,â€ Cuomo said on CNBC. â€œYou have the constitution, you have the law, you have due process, you have equal protection. You canâ€™t use politics just because the majority controls to override the law.â€ The Fifth Amendment of the Constitution, better known for its protection against self-incrimination, also protects individuals from seizure of life, liberty or property without due process and has been interpreted by the Supreme Court as guaranteeing equal protection by the law.  Cuomo and California Governor Jerry Brown, both Democrats, have previously said they were exploring legal challenges to SALT deduction limits.  Law professors have said legal challenges would likely rest on arguing that the provision interferes with the protection of statesâ€™ rights under the U.S. Constitutionâ€™s 10th Amendment. Tax attorneys said Cuomoâ€™s legal argument against the tax bill could be that it discriminates and places an unjust tax burden on states that heavily voted for Democrats in the past - known as â€œblue states.â€ â€œThe de facto effect of this legislation is to discriminate against blue states and particularly from (Cuomoâ€™s) perspective the state of New York,â€ said Joseph Callahan, an attorney with the law firm Mackay, Caswell & Callahan in New York.  But some tax experts noted the U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted the 16th Amendment to give Congress broad latitude to tax as it sees fit. In a frequently cited 1934 decision, the Supreme Court called tax deductions a â€œlegislative graceâ€ rather than a vested right. â€œI donâ€™t understand how they think they have a valid lawsuit here,â€ David Gamage, a professor of tax law at Indiana Universityâ€™s Maurer School of Law, told Reuters last week, speaking generally about governors in blue states that could challenge the tax bill.  Cuomo also said on Thursday that New York is proposing a restructuring of its tax code. He provided no details.  A group of 13 law professors on Dec. 18 published a paper suggesting ways that high-tax states could minimize the effects of the SALT deduction cap.  Their suggestions included shifting more of the tax burden onto businesses in the form of higher employer-side payroll taxes, since the federal tax billâ€™s cap on SALT deductions only applies to individuals and not businesses. States also could raise taxes on pass-through entities, which the federal tax bill specifically benefits with a lower rate on a portion of their income. On Friday, Cuomo said he would allow state residents to make a partial or full pre-payment on their property tax bill before Jan. 1, allowing taxpapyers to deduct such payments for 2017 before the cap kicks in, prompting a wave of residents to pay early.  However, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service on Wednesday advised homeowners that the pre-payment of 2018 property taxes may not be deductible. ",politicsNews,"December 28, 2017 ",Real

Man says he delivered manure to Mnuchin to protest new U.S. tax law," (In Dec. 25 story, in second paragraph, corrects name of Strongâ€™s employer to Mental Health Department, not Public Health Department.) By Bernie Woodall (Reuters) - A man claiming to be the person who delivered a gift-wrapped package of horse manure at the Los Angeles home of U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Monday he did it to protest the federal tax overhaul signed into law last week by President Donald Trump. Robert Strong, 45, a psychologist for the Los Angeles County Mental Health Department, said by telephone he left the poop-filled parcel addressed to Mnuchin and Trump in the driveway outside Mnuchinâ€™s home in the posh Bel Air community.  KNBC-TV, an NBC television affiliate in Los Angeles, reported Mnuchin was not home at the time. The package was found by Mnuchinâ€™s neighbor.    â€œProtest really should be funny,â€ Strong told Reuters. â€œPeopleâ€™s eyes glaze over when they just see angry people in the streets.â€ He believes the new tax law will hurt poor people. Neither the U.S. Secret Service nor the Los Angeles Police Department, both of which investigated the incident, would confirm Strong was responsible. The Secret Service interviewed an individual who admitted delivering the package, but no charges had been filed against him as of Monday afternoon. LAPD Lieutenant Rob Weise said it was possible whoever left the package did not break any criminal laws. While he is not assigned to investigate the incident, Weise said if the box did not present any danger, it would not be illegal. The LAPD bomb squad X-rayed the box before opening it on Saturday. In a photo of the card Strong posted on Twitter, he wrote â€œMisters Mnuchin & Trump, Weâ€™re returning the â€˜giftâ€™ of the Christmas tax billâ€ and signed it â€œWarmest wishes, The American people.â€      Strong said a Secret Service agent, accompanied by six police officers, showed up at his house to question him on Sunday night, and the agent chided him, asking, â€œâ€˜Are you ashamed of your behavior?â€™â€     The White House declined to comment on Monday and officials with the Treasury Department could not be reached.

Virginia officials postpone lottery drawing to decide tied statehouse election,"(Reuters) - A lottery drawing to settle a tied Virginia legislative race that could shift the statehouse balance of power has been indefinitely postponed, state election officials said on Tuesday, after the Democratic candidate mounted a legal fight. The decision to put off the high-stakes lotto, originally scheduled for Wednesday, marks the latest twist in a dramatic election recount that at one point showed Democrat Shelly Simonds beating Republican incumbent David Yancey by a single vote.  A victory by Simonds would shift Republicansâ€™ slim control of the 100-member House of Delegates to an even 50-50 split with the Democrats, forcing the two parties into a rare power-sharing arrangement. A day after Simonds emerged as the victor of a recount, a three-judge panel ruled that a disputed ballot should be counted for Yancey. That decision left the two candidates tied with 11,608 votes each in a district that encompasses the shipping hub of Newport News in southeastern Virginia, setting the stage for the equivalent of a coin toss to pick a final winner. Simonds asked a state court to reconsider on Tuesday, arguing that the disputed ballot was wrongly included. An image filed in court showed that the ballot had bubbles filled in beside both names, with a slash mark by Simondsâ€™ name. The voter selected Republicans for other offices. Simonds told reporters that the case had implications not only for her contest but for the integrity of state elections as a whole, saying that without a court ruling in her favor, â€œrecounts would become a never-ending spiral of courtroom challenges.â€ The chairman of the Virginia Board of Elections, James Alcorn, said in a statement that while holding a lottery would be in keeping with state law, such a move should be considered â€œan action of last resort.â€ He added: â€œAny substantive concerns regarding the election or recount should be resolved before a random drawing is conducted.â€    Yanceyâ€™s campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Virginia House Republican Caucus said in a statement that it was reviewing the new court filings. â€œWe believe the court acted appropriately and that the integrity of the process is without question,â€ spokesman Parker Slaybaugh said. Virginia Department of Elections spokeswoman Andrea Gaines said in an email that no new date for a drawing has been set. Democrats notched historic gains in Virginiaâ€™s statehouse elections last month, part of the partyâ€™s first big wave of political victories since Republican Donald Trump won the White House last year. Before the Nov. 7 general election, Virginia Republicans held 66 seats to the Democratsâ€™ 34 in the House of Delegates, along with a majority in the state Senate.

U.S. lawmakers question businessman at 2016 Trump Tower meeting: sources,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Georgian-American businessman who met then-Miss Universe pageant owner Donald Trump in 2013, has been questioned by congressional investigators about whether he helped organize a meeting between Russians and Trumpâ€™s eldest son during the 2016 election campaign, four sources familiar with the matter said. The meeting at Trump Tower in New York involving Donald Trump Jr. and other campaign advisers is a focus of probes by Congress and Special Counsel Robert Mueller on whether campaign officials colluded with Russia when it sought to interfere in the U.S. election, the sources said. Russia denies allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that it meddled in the election and President Donald Trump denies any collusion. The Senate and House of Representatives intelligence committees recently questioned behind closed doors Irakly Kaveladze, a U.S. citizen born in the former Soviet republic of Georgia, the sources said. He is a U.S.-based representative of Azerbaijani oligarch Aras Agalarovâ€™s real estate firm, the Crocus Group. The panels knew Kaveladze was at the June 9, 2016 meeting but became more interested in him after learning he also attended a private dinner in Las Vegas in 2013 with Trump and Agalarov as they celebrated an agreement to hold that yearâ€™s Miss Universe pageant in Moscow, the sources said.  Committee members now want to know more about the extent of Kaveladzeâ€™s contacts with the Trump family and whether he had a bigger role than previously believed in setting up the Trump Tower meeting when Trump was a Republican candidate for president. The White House declined to comment. Muellerâ€™s office also declined to comment. Scott Balber, a New York lawyer who represents Kaveladze, confirmed that his client attended both the dinner in Las Vegas and the Trump Tower meeting but said he did not set up the second meeting. Trumpâ€™s son-in-law Jared Kushner, other Trump campaign aides, and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya were also at that meeting. Lawyer Balber also said the committees were only seeking Kaveladzeâ€™s input as a witness and were not targeting him for investigation. â€œNo-one has ever told me that they have any interest in him other than as a witness,â€ Balber said. Lawyers for Trump Jr. and Kushner did not respond to requests for comment about their contacts with Kaveladze.Â A lawyer for President Trump declined to comment. One photograph from the 2013 dinner, when Trump still owned the Miss Universe pageant, shows Agalarov and his pop singer son Emin along with Trump, two Trump aides and several other people at the dining table. Another shows Kaveladze standing behind Trump and Emin Agalarov as they speak. The pictures were found by a University of California at Irvine student and blogger Scott Stedman, who posted them on Nov. 22. Aras Agalarov is a billionaire property developer in Russia who was awarded the Order of Honor by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Several U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said Muellerâ€™s team and the committees are looking for any evidence of a link between the Trump Tower meeting and the release six weeks later of emails stolen from Democratic Party organizations. They are also trying to determine whether there was any discussion at the New York meeting of lifting U.S. economic sanctions on Russia, a top priority for Putin, the officials said. Rob Goldstone, a British publicist, told Trump Jr. ahead of the New York meeting that Russian lawyer Veselnitskaya would be bringing damaging information about donations to a charity linked to Trumpâ€™s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, according to emails later released by Trump Jr. Trump Jr. initially said the meeting was about Russian adoptions but later said it also included Veselnitskayaâ€™s promises of information on the donations to the Clinton charity. He said he ultimately never received the information, although it was later posted on the Internet. In a statement issued after meeting with the Senate Judiciary Committee on Sept. 7, Trump, Jr. said Goldstone and Veselnitskaya were in a conference room with him as well as Kaveladze and a translator. Balber said Kaveladze attended expecting to serve as a translator, although he did not do so in the end because Veselnitskaya brought her own. ",politicsNews,"December 27, 2017 ",Real

U.S. appeals court rejects challenge to Trump voter fraud panel,"(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court in Washington on Tuesday upheld a lower courtâ€™s decision to allow President Donald Trumpâ€™s commission investigating voter fraud to request data on voter rolls from U.S. states. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) watchdog group, which filed the lawsuit, did not have legal standing to seek to force the presidential commission to review privacy concerns before collecting individualsâ€™ voter data. EPIC had argued that under federal law, the commission was required to conduct a privacy-impact assessment before gathering personal data. But the three-judge appeals court panel ruled unanimously that the privacy law at issue was intended to protect individuals, not groups like EPIC. â€œEPIC is not a voter,â€ Judge Karen Henderson wrote in the ruling.  Washington-based U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly first denied EPICâ€™s injunction request in July, in part because the collection of data by the commission was not technically an action by a government agency so was not bound by laws that govern what such entities can do.  Kollar-Kotelly noted that the commission, headed by Vice President Mike Pence, was an advisory body that lacks legal authority to compel states to hand over the data. Most state officials who oversee elections and election law experts say that voter fraud is rare in the United States. Trump, a Republican, set up the commission in May after charging, without evidence, that millions of people voted unlawfully in the 2016 presidential election in which he defeated Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton despite losing the popular vote.  The commissionâ€™s vice chair, Kris Kobach, the Republican secretary of state for Kansas and an advocate of tougher laws on immigration and voter identification, asked states in June to turn over voter information. The data requested by Kobach included names, the last four digits of Social Security numbers, addresses, birth dates, political affiliation, felony convictions and voting histories.  More than 20 states refused outright and others said they needed to study whether they could provide the data. Civil rights groups and Democratic lawmakers have said the commissionâ€™s eventual findings could lead to new ID requirements and other measures making it harder for groups that tend to favor Democratic candidates to cast ballots. EPIC executive director Marc Rotenberg could not immediately be reached for comment. ",politicsNews,"December 26, 2017 ",Real
Treasury Secretary Mnuchin was sent gift-wrapped box of horse manure: reports,"(Reuters) - A gift-wrapped package addressed to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchinâ€™s home in a posh Los Angeles neighborhood that was suspected of being a bomb was instead filled with horse manure, police told local media. The package was found Saturday evening in a next-door neighborâ€™s driveway in Bel Air, the Los Angeles Police Department told the Los Angeles Times and KNBC television, the NBC affiliate in Los Angeles. The package also included a Christmas card with negative comments about President Donald Trump and the new U.S. tax law signed by Trump last week. Reuters could not reach LAPD officials for comment on Sunday. An LAPD bomb squad X-rayed the package before opening it and found the horse manure inside, police told local media. Aerial footage from KNBC showed officers investigating a large box in wrapping paper, then dumping a large amount of what they later identified as the manure and opening the card that was included inside.  Mnuchin, who KNBC said was not home when the package was discovered, is a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc executive and Hollywood film financier. A road in Bel Air was closed for about two hours, KNBC reported. The U.S. Secret Service is also investigating the incident, according to the TV station. ",politicsNews,"December 24, 2017 ",Real
Federal judge partially lifts Trump's latest refugee restrictions,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal judge in Seattle partially blocked U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s newest restrictions on refugee admissions on Saturday, the latest legal defeat for his efforts to curtail immigration and travel to the United States. The decision by U.S. District Judge James Robart is the first judicial curb on rules the Trump administration put into place in late October that have contributed significantly to a precipitous drop in the number of refugees being admitted into the country. Refugees and groups that assist them argued in court that the administrationâ€™s policies violated the Constitution and federal rulemaking procedures, among other claims. Department of Justice attorneys argued in part that U.S. law grants the executive branch the authority to limit refugee admissions in the way that it had done so. On Oct. 24, the Trump administration effectively paused refugee admissions from 11 countries mostly in the Middle East and Africa, pending a 90-day security review, which was set to expire in late January. The countries subject to the review are Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Mali, North Korea, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. For each of the last three years, refugees from the 11 countries made up more than 40 percent of U.S. admissions. A Reuters review of State Department data showed that as the review went into effect, refugee admissions from the 11 countries plummeted. Robart ruled that the administration could carry out the security review, but that it could not stop processing or admitting refugees from the 11 countries in the meantime, as long as those refugees have a â€œbona fideâ€ connection to the United States. As part of its new restrictions, the Trump administration had also paused a program that allowed for family reunification for refugees, pending further security screening procedures being put into place. Robart ordered the government to re-start the program, known as â€œfollow-to-joinâ€. Approximately 2,000 refugees were admitted into the United States in fiscal year 2015 under the program, according to Department of Homeland Security data. Refugee advocacy groups praised Robartâ€™s decision.  â€œThis ruling brings relief to thousands of refugees in precarious situations in the Middle East and East Africa, as well as to refugees already in the U.S. who are trying to reunite with their spouses and children,â€ said Mariko Hirose, litigation director for the International Refugee Assistance Project, one of the plaintiffs in the case. A Justice Department spokeswoman, Lauren Ehrsam, said the department disagrees with Robartâ€™s ruling and is â€œcurrently evaluating the next stepsâ€. Robart, who was appointed to the bench by Republican former President George W. Bush, emerged from relative obscurity in February, when he issued a temporary order to lift the first version of Trumpâ€™s travel ban. On Twitter, Trump called him a â€œso-called judgeâ€ whose â€œridiculousâ€ opinion â€œessentially takes law-enforcement away from our countryâ€. Robartâ€™s ruling represented the second legal defeat in two days for the Trump administration. On Friday, a U.S. appeals court said Trumpâ€™s travel ban targeting six Muslim-majority countries should not be applied to people with strong U.S. ties, but said its ruling would be put on hold pending a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court.

Exclusive: U.S. memo weakens guidelines for protecting immigrant children in court,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has issued new guidelines for immigration judges that remove some instructions for how to protect unaccompanied juveniles appearing in their courtrooms. A Dec. 20 memo, issued by the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) replaces 2007 guidelines, spelling out policies and procedures judges should follow in dealing with children who crossed the border illegally alone and face possible deportation.  The new memo removes suggestions contained in the 2007 memo for how to conduct â€œchild-sensitive questioningâ€ and adds reminders to judges to maintain â€œimpartialityâ€ even though â€œjuvenile cases may present sympathetic allegations.â€ The new document also changes the word â€œchildâ€ to â€œunmarried individual under the age of 18â€ in many instances. (Link to comparison: tmsnrt.rs/2BlT0VK May 2007 document: tmsnrt.rs/2BBR8wj December 2017 document: tmsnrt.rs/2C2sWCs)  An EOIR official said the new memo contained â€œclarifications and updatesâ€ to 10-year-old guidance â€œin order to be consistent with the laws as theyâ€™ve been passed by Congress.â€ The new memo was posted on the Justice Department website but has not been previously reported.  Immigration advocates said they worry the new guidelines could make court appearances for children more difficult, and a spokeswoman for the union representing immigration judges said judges are concerned about the tone of the memo. President Donald Trump has made tougher immigration enforcement a key policy goal of his administration, and has focused particularly on trying to curb the illegal entry of children. The administration says it wants to prevent vulnerable juveniles from making perilous journeys to the United States and eliminate fraud from programs for young immigrants.  One changed section of the memo focuses on how to make children comfortable in the court in advance of hearings. The old guidance says they â€œshould be permitted to exploreâ€ courtrooms and allowed to â€œsit in all locations, (including, especially, the judgeâ€™s bench and the witness stand).â€  The new guidance says such explorations should take place only â€œto the extent that resources and time permitâ€ and specifically puts the judgeâ€™s bench off limits. The new memo also warns judges to be skeptical, since an unaccompanied minor â€œgenerally receives more favorable treatment under the law than other categories of illegal aliens,â€ which creates â€œan incentive to misrepresent accompaniment status or age in order to attempt to qualify for the benefits.â€ It also says to be on the lookout for â€œfraud and abuse,â€ language that was not in the previous memo. Immigration judges are appointed by the U.S. Attorney General and courts are part of the Department of Justice, not an independent branch. The only sitting immigration judges routinely allowed to speak to the media are representatives of their union, the National Association of Immigration Judges.  Dana Marks, a sitting judge and spokeswoman for the union, said the â€œoverall toneâ€ of the memo â€œis very distressing and concerning to immigration judges.â€  â€œThere is a feeling that the immigration courts are just being demoted into immigration enforcement offices, rather than neutral arbiters,â€ Marks said. â€œThere has been a relentless beating of the drum toward enforcement rather than due process.â€   Former immigration judge Andrew Arthur, who now works at the Center for Immigration Studies, which promotes lower levels of immigration overall, said the new guidelines were needed.  In their previous form, he said, â€œso much emphasis was placed on the potential inability of the alien to understand the proceedings ... that it almost put the judge into the position of being an advocate.â€Â   The courts have had to handle a surge in cases for unaccompanied minors, mostly from Central America, after their numbers sky-rocketed in 2014 as violence in the region caused residents to flee north.  While illegal crossings initially fell after Trump took office, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said that since May, each month has seen an increase in children being apprehended either alone or with family members.  Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a speech in Boston in September that the special accommodations for unaccompanied minors had been exploited by â€œgang members who come to this country as wolves in sheep clothing.â€ Echoing some of these concerns, the new memo notes in a preamble that not all child cases involve innocents, and that the courts might see â€œan adolescent gang memberâ€ or â€œa teenager convicted as an adult for serious criminal activity.â€  Jennifer Podkul, policy director of Kids in Need of Defense (KIND) said Congress included special procedural protections for immigrant children in a 2008 anti-trafficking bill to â€œmake sure that a kid gets a fair shot in the courtroom.â€ â€œThese kids are by themselves telling a very complicated and oftentimes very traumatic story,â€ said Podkul. â€œThe approach of this memo, which is much more suspicious, is not going to help get to the truth of a childâ€™s story.â€  In cases where children are called to testify, the old guidance instructed judges to â€œseek to limit the amount of time the child is on the stand.â€ The new guidance says that judges should â€œconsiderâ€ limiting the childâ€™s time on the stand â€œwithout compromising due process for the opposing party,â€ which is generally a government prosecutor. The memo leaves in a range of special accommodations made for children, including allowing them to bring a pillow or booster seat or a â€œtoy, book, or other personal item.â€ It also maintains that cases involving unaccompanied minors should be heard on a separate docket when possible and that children should not be detained or transported with adults.

Trump travel ban should not apply to people with strong U.S. ties: court,"(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Friday said President Donald Trumpâ€™s hotly contested travel ban targeting people from six Muslim-majority countries should not be applied to people with strong U.S. ties. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers several West Coast states, also said its ruling would be put on hold pending a decision on the latest version of the travel ban from the Trump administration by the U.S. Supreme Court. Since taking office in January, Trump has been struggling to enact a ban that passes court muster. A three-judge panel from the 9th Circuit narrowed a previous injunction from a lower federal court to those people â€œwith a credible bona fide relationship with the United States.â€ It also said that while the U.S. president has broad powers to regulate the entry of immigrants into the United States, those powers are not without limits. â€œWe conclude that the Presidentâ€™s issuance of the Proclamation once again exceeds the scope of his delegated authority,â€ the panel said. The ban targets people from Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen seeking to enter the United States. Trump, a Republican, has said the travel ban is needed to protect the United States from terrorism. The state of Hawaii, however, challenged it in court, and a Honolulu federal judge said it exceeded Trumpâ€™s powers under immigration law. Trumpâ€™s ban also covers people from North Korea and certain government officials from Venezuela, but the lower courts had already allowed those provisions to go into effect. The same three-judge 9th Circuit panel, which limited a previous version of Trumpâ€™s ban, heard arguments earlier this month. Trump issued his first travel ban targeting several Muslim-majority countries in January, which caused chaos at airports and mass protests. He issued a revised one in March after the first was blocked by federal courts. That expired in September after a court fight and was replaced with the current version. The ban has some exceptions. Certain people from each targeted country can still apply for a visa for tourism, business or education purposes, and applicants can ask for an individual waiver. â€œWe are pleased that the Supreme Court has already allowed the government to implement the proclamation and keep all Americans safe while this matter is litigated. We continue to believe that the order should be allowed to take effect in its entirety,â€ U.S. Justice Department spokeswoman Lauren Ehrsam said in a statement.

Second court rejects Trump bid to stop transgender military recruits,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal appeals court in Washington on Friday rejected a bid by President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration to prevent the U.S. military from accepting transgender recruits starting Jan. 1, the second court to issue such a ruling this week. Four federal judges around the country have issued injunctions blocking Trumpâ€™s ban on transgender people from the military, including one that was also handed down on Friday. The administration has appealed the previous three rulings. In a six-page order, the three-judge-panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said the administration had â€œnot shown a strong likelihood that they will succeed on the merits of their challengeâ€ to a district courtâ€™s order blocking the ban. On Thursday the Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said it was denying the administrationâ€™s request while the appeal proceeds. The two courtsâ€™ actions could prompt the administration to ask the conservative-majority U.S. Supreme Court to intervene. Also on Friday, a federal trial court in Riverside, California, blocked the ban while the case proceeds, making it the fourth to do so, after similar rulings in Baltimore, Seattle and Washington, D.C. U.S. District Judge Jesus Bernal said without the injunction the plaintiffs, including current and aspiring service members, would suffer irreparable harm. â€œThere is nothing any court can do to remedy a government-sent message that some citizens are not worthy of the military uniform simply because of their gender,â€ he added. The administration had argued that the Jan. 1 deadline for accepting transgender recruits was problematic because tens of thousands of personnel would have to be trained on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants, and the military was not ready for that. The Obama administration had set a deadline of July 1, 2017, to begin accepting transgender recruits, but Trumpâ€™s defense secretary, James Mattis, postponed that date to Jan. 1. In an August memorandum, Trump gave the military until March 2018 to revert to a policy prohibiting openly transgender individuals from joining the military and authorizing their discharge. The memo also halted the use of government funds for sex-reassignment surgery for active-duty personnel. ",politicsNews,"December 23, 2017 ",Real
Failed vote to oust president shakes up Peru's politics,"LIMA (Reuters) - Peruâ€™s President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski could end up the surprise winner of an attempt to oust him from power this week, after some opposition lawmakers broke ranks with party leaders to support him, opening a divide that might strengthen his hand. Despite having a Congressional majority, the rightwing opposition party Popular Force was unable to push through a motion to remove Kuczynski from office on Thursday, after 10 of its own lawmakers broke ranks to save the president. The vote cemented a growing divide in the opposition and looked to threaten its control over Congress, potentially aiding Kuczynski as he tries to restore political stability and revive investments in one of Latin Americaâ€™s most robust economies. The surprise defection was the result of a deal struck between Kuczynski and Popular Force rebel lawmaker Kenji Fujimori to get his father and ex-president Alberto Fujimori out of prison, alleged Popular Force secretary general, Jose Chlimper. Over the past year, Kenji has courted Kuczynskiâ€™s center-right government while challenging his sister Keikoâ€™s leadership of the rightwing populist movement that their father formed in the 1990s. In defiance of his sister, Kenji threw his support behind Kuczynski ahead of the vote on whether to remove him from office over unproven graft allegations. Nine other Popular Force lawmakers followed his lead. â€œThis is the birth of a serious and formal split (in the Fujimori movement),â€ said Guillermo Loli, the head of political research for pollster Ipsos Peru. â€œEverything points to a pardon,â€ he added.     Kuczynskiâ€™s government denied that a pardon for Fujimori was part of its political negotiations. In an address to the nation late on Friday, Kuczynski said he would spend the coming days reflecting on his year and a half in office. â€œIâ€™ll be announcing to you changes to make sure 2018 is not just a year of greater growth, but politically different,â€ Kuczynski said. Efforts to reach the Popular Force lawmakers who defected were not successful. One, Clayton Galvan, said on local TV channel Canal N that Alberto Fujimori called them from prison to ask them to help Kuczynski stay in power.     Alberto Fujimori, who is serving a 25-year sentence for graft and human rights crimes, is a deeply divisive figure in Peru. While many consider him a corrupt dictator, others credit him with ending an economic crisis and bloody leftist insurgency during his 1990-2000 term. Freeing him would likely anger the well-organized foes of the Fujimori clan - a mix of technocrats, leftists, human rights activists and academics. â€œThe day (Kuczynski) signs a pardon, he loses all of those guys. Permanently,â€ said Harvard University political scientist Steve Levitsky. Support from the anti-Fujimori crowd was key to Kuczynskiâ€™s razor-thin victory over Keiko in last yearâ€™s presidential election, and to keeping the motion to oust him from succeeding. â€œKuczynski was saved by two diametrically opposed political groups: Kenjiâ€™s group and the left, which opposes a pardon. He canâ€™t please both of them,â€ said Levitsky. Kuczynski, a 79-year-old former investment banker, took office amid hopes he would usher in cleaner government and faster economic growth. Instead, a graft scandal roiling Latin America has stalled investments and ensnared him in allegations of wrongdoing. Before the vote on Thursday, Kuczynski fanned fears of a return to Peruâ€™s authoritarian past and described the motion as part of a legislative â€œcoupâ€ attempt by Keikoâ€™s supporters. Popular Force denies the charge and says the bid to remove him was part of its fight against corruption and within the bounds of the constitution. A hardline Popular Force lawmaker loyal to Keiko, Hector Becerril, said the Kenji faction represented â€œtraitors.â€  â€œIf they have any sense of decency after this vote, the least they could do is present their resignations,â€ Becerril told journalists on Friday. â€œHopefully today.â€ With 10 votes fewer, Popular Force would command 61 seats in the 130-member, single-chamber Congress, less than an absolute majority, though it would still be the biggest voting bloc. The political crisis has cost Kuczynski his interior minister, Carlos Basombrio, who announced his resignation on Friday.

"Trump signs tax, government spending bills into law","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed Republicansâ€™ massive $1.5 trillion tax overhaul into law on Friday, cementing the biggest legislative victory of his first year in office, and also approved a short-term spending bill that averts a possible government shutdown. Trump said he wanted to sign the tax bill before leaving Washington on Friday for his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, rather than stage a more formal ceremony in January, so he could keep his promise to finish work before Christmas. â€œI didnâ€™t want you folks to say I wasnâ€™t keeping my promise. Iâ€™m keeping my promise,â€ he told reporters in the White House. The two pieces of legislation represent Trumpâ€™s most significant accomplishment with Congress since taking office in January, as well as a sign of what awaits when he returns from Florida after the Christmas holiday. The tax package, the largest such overhaul since the 1980s, slashes the corporate rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and temporarily reduces the tax burden for most individuals as well. Trump praised several companies that have announced employee bonuses in the wake of the billâ€™s passage, naming AT&T, Boeing, Wells Fargo, Comcast  and Sinclair Broadcast Group. â€œCorporations are literally going wild over this,â€ he said.      Democrats had opposed the bill as a giveaway to the wealthy that would add $1.5 trillion to the $20 trillion national debt during the next decade. The spending bill extends federal funding through Jan. 19, largely at current levels. It does nothing to resolve broader disputes over immigration, healthcare and military spending. Republicans also are divided over whether to follow up their sweeping overhaul of the U.S. tax code with a dramatic restructuring of federal benefit programs. House Speaker Paul Ryan has said he would like to revamp welfare and health programs but Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell told National Public Radio on Monday that he was not interested in cutting those programs without Democratic support. Trumpâ€™s year also closes with significant turnover of many top staffers who had been in the White House since early in his term. On Friday, the White House confirmed Deputy Chief of Staff Rick Dearborn and Jeremy Katz, who worked under White House economic adviser Gary Cohn, were leaving.

Companies have up to a year for new U.S. tax bill reporting: SEC,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. financial regulators said on Friday that because the new tax bill could make timely financial reporting difficult, public companies can make reasonable estimates when uncertain of the impact of the new tax law in financial reports, and will have up to a year to report final numbers.               The Securities and Exchange Commission bulletin comes after the U.S. Chamber of Commerce warned on Thursday that some U.S. listed companies may struggle to file their annual financial reports on time because the Republican-led overhaul of the countryâ€™s tax system may prompt a raft of additional disclosures. In a statement on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TJCA) issued on Friday, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton and Commissioners Kara Stein and Michael Piwowar said guidance was similar to that given in the past when tax law changes affected financial reporting. The $1.5 trillion tax bill, signed into law on Friday by U.S. President Donald Trump, will significantly affect many companiesâ€™ year-end financial statements because listing rules oblige them to flag any potential material risks or changes to their operations and financial outlook to shareholders. The bill significantly lowers the income tax rate for U.S. companies - to 21 percent from 35 percent - allows them to repatriate cash from overseas, and modifies numerous deductions, among other changes.  Public companies have been given a â€œmeasurement periodâ€ to study the changes created by a new law. During the measurement period, the SEC expects companies to complete their accounting and that â€œin no circumstances should the measurement period extend beyond one year from the enactment date,â€ of the TJCA. Companies will also need to make disclosures during the measurement period, including any updates to provisional amounts given earlier, or newly discovered reporting implications from tax bill. For companies with fiscal years ending Dec. 31, getting the necessary analysis done in time could be tough, the Chamber said. The tax bill It is the largest such overhaul since the 1980. In addition to slashing the corporate rate, it temporarily reduces the tax burden for most individuals.     ",politicsNews,"December 23, 2017 ",Real

Senate leader McConnell sees a more collegial 2018,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Friday said a shifting landscape will lead him to work with Democrats on immigration and financial regulation early in the new year, following a year of acrimony and partisan legislation. In an end-of-year news conference, McConnell touted a list of Republican accomplishments since President Donald Trump took office in January. It started with the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court and ended with an overhaul of the  U.S. tax code. But in January, McConnellâ€™s already razor-thin 52-48 Republican majority will shrink to 51-49 with the swearing in of Senator-elect Doug Jones, the Democrat who surprised the political world with a win in a special election in the deeply Republican state of Alabama. Adding to McConnellâ€™s difficulties, special Senate procedures are fading that allowed him to pass a tax bill and try to repeal the Affordable Care Act this year without any Democratic support. That means that McConnellâ€™s victories - if he has them - will require more collaboration and less confrontation. The pivot was the centerpiece of his news conference remarks.  â€œThere are areas where I think we can get bipartisan agreement,â€ McConnell said. First on his list was legislation to change Dodd-Frank banking regulations that he said would help smaller financial institutions. The Kentucky senator noted that Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo has advanced legislation that is co-sponsored by several Democrats. McConnell also pointed to bipartisan efforts to help undocumented immigrants, known as â€œDreamers,â€ who were brought into the United States when they were children. If negotiators from both parties can come to a deal for the Dreamers that Trumpâ€™s administration can support, â€œweâ€™ll spend floor time on that in January,â€ McConnell said. On Thursday, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer complained that throughout 2017 Republicans â€œhave been hell-bent on pursuing a partisan agenda.â€ When asked by a reporter of possible bipartisan successes in 2018, Schumer pointed to the need for infrastructure improvements but said that Trump has been â€œall over the lotâ€ on how to accomplish road, airport and other construction projects. With the November 2018 congressional elections approaching, Democrats might have less incentive to cooperate with Republicans, especially after Schumerâ€™s party won decisive victories in special elections this month and last in Alabama and Virginia. McConnell hinted it would be tougher to find agreement with Democrats on some other legislative issues, including welfare reform, which Trump says he wants to push ahead with in 2018. McConnell said he would consult with Trump and House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan in January over prospects for welfare reform.  ",politicsNews,"December 22, 2017 ",Real

McConnell happier with Trump tweets after tax victory,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A summer spat between President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has turned into a warm embrace - and all it took was a sweeping rewrite of the U.S. tax code.     For months, McConnell urged the president to lock his cell phone in a drawer and retire his signature tweets that have Washington abuzz on a daily basis. He even chided Trump for having â€œexcessive expectationsâ€ of Congress. For his part, Trump scorched McConnell in August for failing to repeal Obamacare, sidestepped reportersâ€™ questions over whether the senator should retire and tweeted, â€œMitch, get to work.â€ But with Congressâ€™ passage of the tax bill this week, giving Trump his first major legislative victory, the president tweeted on Wednesday, â€œI would like to congratulate @SenateMajLdr on having done a fantastic job.â€ McConnell joined in the love fest on Friday, or at least what constitutes a love fest for the understated senator. â€œWith regard to the presidentâ€™s tweeting habits, I havenâ€™t been a fan until this week. Iâ€™m warming up to it,â€ McConnell quipped. Still, he reined in reporters who asked whether he might visit Trump in Mar-a-Lago, the presidentâ€™s Florida resort, over the Christmas and New Year holidays.

Callista Gingrich becomes Trump's envoy to pope as differences mount,"VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Callista Gingrich, wife of the former speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, on Friday became U.S. ambassador to the Vatican, which is at odds with Washington over immigration, climate change and Jerusalem. Callista Gingrich, 51, an author, documentary filmmaker and former congressional aide, presented her credentials to Pope Francis at the Vatican to officially assume her role. Her husband Newt Gingrich was an early supporter and vocal ally of U.S. President Donald Trump. Newt Gingrich is expected to continue his role as a political contributor to Fox News from his new base in Rome. Trumpâ€™s nomination of Callista Gingrich to the post at the Holy See in May caused some controversy because of her marriage to Gingrich, with whom she became involved when he was still married to his second wife. Both are Roman Catholic. On Thursday they attended the funeral at the Vatican of Cardinal Bernard Law, who resigned as Archbishop of Boston 15 years ago after covering up years of sexual abuse of children by priests.  The pope has implicitly criticized Trumpâ€™s decision to pull out of the Paris accord on climate change. He said last month that denying climate change or being indifferent to its effects were â€œperverse attitudesâ€ that blocked research and dialogue aimed at protecting the future of the planet. Francis is also opposed to Trumpâ€™s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israelâ€™s capital. The pontiff has called for respect for the cityâ€™s â€œstatus quo,â€ saying new tension in the Middle East would further inflame world conflicts.. On Thursday at the United Nations, where the Vatican has permanent observer status, more than 120 countries defied Trump and voted in favor of a resolution calling for the United States to drop its recent recognition.

"As Republicans aim to ride economy to election victory, a warning from voters in key district"," KING OF PRUSSIA, Pennsylvania/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In the Fox & Hound sports bar, next to a shopping mall in suburban Philadelphia, four Democrats are giving speeches to potential voters as they begin their journey to try to unseat Republican congressman Pat Meehan in next yearâ€™s elections. Winning this congressional district - Pennsylvaniaâ€™s 7th - is key to Democratsâ€™ hopes of gaining the 24 seats they need to retake the U.S. House of Representatives next November. The stakes are high - control of the House would allow them to block President Donald Trumpâ€™s legislative agenda. On the surface, Democrats face a significant hurdle. In nearly two-thirds of 34 Republican-held districts that are top of the partyâ€™s target list, household income or job growth, and often both, have risen faster than state and national averages over the past two years, according to a Reuters analysis of census data.Â (Graphic:Â tmsnrt.rs/2Bgq29K) That is potentially vote-winning news for Republican incumbents, who in speeches and television ads can trumpet a strengthening economy as a product of Republican control of Washington, even though incomes and job growth began improving under former Democratic President Barack Obama. â€œThe good economy is really the only positive keeping Republicans afloat,â€ said David Wasserman, a congressional analyst with the non-partisan Cook Political Report. Still, trumpeting the good economy may have limited impact among voters in competitive districts like this mostly white southeast region of Pennsylvania bordering Delaware and New Jersey, which has switched between both parties twice in the past 15 years. Many of the two dozen voters that Reuters interviewed in the 6th and 7th districts agreed the economy was strong, that jobs were returning and wages were growing. A handful were committed Republicans and Democrats who always vote the party line. About half voted for Meehan last year, but most of those said they were unsure whether they would vote for him again in 2018. Some said they were disappointed with the Republican Partyâ€™s handling of healthcare and tax reform as well as Trumpâ€™s erratic performance. About half also felt that despite an improving economy, living costs are squeezing the middle class. Drew McGinty, one of the Democratic hopefuls at the Fox & Hound bar hoping to unseat Meehan, said the good economic numbers were misleading. â€œWhen I talk to people across the district, I hear about stagnant wages. I hear about massive debt young people are getting when they finish college. Thereâ€™s a lot out there not being told by the numbers,â€ he said. Still, Meehan, who won by 19 points in last Novemberâ€™s general election, is confident the strong economy will help him next year. He plans to run as a job creator and a champion of the middle class. â€œThe first thing people look at is whether they have got a job and income,â€ Meehan said in a telephone interview. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton carried the district by more than two points in the White House race, giving Democrats some hope that they can peel it away from Republicans next November. Kyle Kondik, a political analyst at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, said the election will essentially be a referendum on Trump. The economy might help Republicans, he said, but other issues will likely be uppermost in votersâ€™ minds, like the Republican tax overhaul - which is seen by some as favoring the rich over the middle class - and Trumpâ€™s dismantling of President Barack Obamaâ€™s initiative to expand healthcare to millions of Americans, popularly known as Obamacare. Indeed, healthcare is Americansâ€™ top concern, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted earlier this month. Next is terrorism and then the economy. â€œHealthcare will be the No. 1 issue,â€ in the election, predicted Molly Sheehan, another Democrat running to unseat Meehan. Democrats have warned that dismantling Obamacare will leave millions of Americans without health coverage, and political analysts say Republicans in vulnerable districts could be punished by angry voters. Republicans argue that Obamacare drives up costs for consumers and interferes with personal medical decisions. In Broomall, a hamlet in the 7th District, local builder Greg Dulgerian, 55, said he voted for Trump and Meehan. He still likes Trump because of his image as a political outsider, but he is less certain about Meehan. â€œIâ€™m busy, which is good,â€ Dulgerian said. â€œBut I actually make less than I did 10 years ago, because my living costs and costs of materials have gone up.â€ Dulgerian said he was not sure what Meehan was doing to address this, and he was open to a Democratic candidate with a plan to help the middle class. Ida McCausland, 65, is a registered Republican but said she is disappointed with the party. She views the overhaul of the tax system as a giveaway to the rich that will hit the middle class. â€œI will probably just go Democrat,â€ she said. Still, others interviewed said the good economy was the most important issue for them and would vote for Meehan. Â Â Â  Mike Allard, 35, a stocks day trader, voted for Clinton last year but did not cast a ballot in the congressional vote. He thinks the economy will help Meehan next year and is leaning toward voting for him. â€œLocal businesses like the way the economy is going right now,â€ he said. In the 7th district median household income jumped more than 10 percent from 2014 to 2016, from $78,000 to around $86,000, above the national average increase of 7.3 percent, while job growth held steady, the analysis of the census data shows. Overall, the U.S. economy has grown 3 percent in recent quarters, and some forecasters now think theÂ stimulus from the Republican tax cuts will sustain that rate of growth through next year. Unemployment has dropped to 4.1 percent, a 17-year low. In midterm congressional elections, history shows that voters often focus on issues other than the economy. In 1966 the economy was thriving, but President Lyndon B. Johnsonâ€™s Democrats suffered a net loss of 47 seats, partly because of growing unhappiness with the Vietnam War. In 2006, again the economy was humming, but Republicans lost a net 31 seats in the House, as voters focused on the Iraq war and the unpopularity of Republican President George W. Bush. In 2010, despite pulling the economy out of a major recession, Democrats lost control of the House to Republicans, mainly because of the passage of Obamacare, which at the time was highly unpopular with many voters. â€œWhen times are bad, the election is almost always about the economy. When the economy is good, people have the freedom and the ability to worry about other issues,â€ said Stu Rothenberg, a veteran political analyst. ",politicsNews,"December 22, 2017 ",Real
Exclusive: State Department tells refugee agencies to downsize U.S. operations,"(Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has told refugee agencies it will sharply pare back the number of offices across the country authorized to resettle people in 2018 as President Donald Trump cuts the number of refugees allowed into the United States. The announcement was made at a Dec. 1 meeting in Washington with State Department officials and representatives from nine major refugee agencies, several executives of the agencies said. Advocates said the decision is likely to lead to the closure of dozens of resettlement offices around the country, potentially leaving some refugees without access to services that help them integrate into American life. Several state refugee coordinators said they had also been made aware of the closures. Â Â Â  Refugee resettlement in the United States is handled by nine non-profit agencies that receive funding from the federal government for some of their refugee work. They partner with, or oversee, hundreds of local offices in nearly every state that help new arrivals with basic tasks like enrolling children in school, arranging doctorsâ€™ visits and applying for Social Security cards and other documents.  Though the agencies are independent, they must get government approval for where they will resettle new refugees.  Aid workers and state officials involved in refugee resettlement said the agencies were informed by the State Department in the Dec. 1 meeting that offices expected to handle fewer than 100 refugees in fiscal year 2018 will no longer be authorized to resettle new arrivals, which means many of them will have to close. There are about 300 resettlement offices spread across 49 states, and advocates estimate several dozen are at risk, though shuttering plans will not be finalized until next year. The Trump administration has said it wants refugees to assimilate quickly, both to promote national security and so that they can become self-sufficient. Refugee advocates say the closure of local offices will undermine that goal. They say the offices play a crucial role in helping newcomers traumatized from having fled conflict or persecution. Even if no new refugees are resettled by the offices they still have an obligation to help those already here, they say.  If refugees lose access to â€œservices to help them navigate the processes of registering for school, and English classes and finding a job, that will mean that it will take longer for them to navigate life in the United States and contribute to our economy,â€ said Robert Carey, who directed the Office of Refugee Resettlement under former President Barack Obama.  A State Department official confirmed the Dec. 1 meeting and said the agency is looking to â€œreduce costs and simplify management structures to help the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program run in a way that is fiscally responsible and sustainable.â€  Some conservative groups that favor lower immigration said they would welcome curbs on the agenciesâ€™ activities. â€œThese organizations have to adapt when their services are no longer needed as much,â€ said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies. â€œThere is no reason to keep funneling money to them.â€ Joshua Meservey, a senior policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation who formerly worked in refugee resettlement, said that costs need to be balanced against benefits. â€œIt is unclear to me if the assimilation gains are great enough to justify the extra expenseâ€ of funding the smaller agencies, he said. The nine agencies are now trying to coordinate closures so that they can maintain at least one resettlement agency in as many states as possible, several agency executives said. â€œWeâ€™re hoping that they (the State Department) only close sites where there is possible duplication,â€ said Mark Hetfield, president of HIAS, one of the nine agencies. â€œThis is going to have to be a negotiation and a process.â€ Since taking office in January, Trump has moved to sharply reduce refugee admissions to the United States, because of national security concerns and a belief that money could be better spent resettling people closer to their original homes. Soon after taking office, he slashed the 2017 U.S. refugee cap to 50,000 from the 110,000 ceiling set by Obama. In September, he announced a cap of 45,000 for 2018, the lowest number since the modern U.S. refugee program was established in 1980. The resettlement office in Chattanooga, Tennessee is at risk of shutting down, because it is only projected to receive about 85 refugees, said Holly Johnson, the stateâ€™s refugee coordinator. â€œSmall doesnâ€™t necessarily mean weak or subpar,â€ Johnson said. â€œThey spend more time with folks, they have really well-established connections to the community, so people feel welcomed, which really helps.â€ Until this year, Idaho had four resettlement offices - three in Boise and one in Twin Falls, said Jan Reeves, director of the Idaho Office for Refugees, a non-profit which administers resettlement in the state. Earlier this year one of the sites in Boise shut down, he said. â€œIt was disruptive, and weâ€™ve lost a really valuable partner and weâ€™ve lost some capacity to do the job,â€ he said.

"Congress votes to avert shutdown, sends Trump stopgap spending bill","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress on Thursday averted a government shutdown just one day before federal funding was due to expire, sending President Donald Trump a bill to provide just enough money to keep agencies operating through Jan. 19. With lawmakers eager to begin a holiday recess until Jan. 3, the House of Representatives and Senate scurried to pass the hastily written bill by votes of 231-188 and 66-32, respectively. When Congress returns, lawmakers will immediately have to get back to work on appropriating more money for a fiscal year that already will be three months old. They will try to pass an â€œomnibusâ€ spending bill to fund the government from Jan. 19 through Sept. 30. Negotiators have been struggling for months over thorny issues such as the amount of defense-spending increases versus increases for other domestic programs, including medical research, opioid treatment and â€œanti-terrorismâ€ activities. Fiscal hawks, meanwhile, are angry that Congress is again moving to bust through spending caps that had been designed to tamp down mounting federal debt. But some of those same lawmakers in the Republican-controlled Congress earlier in the week voted for a sweeping tax bill that will add $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years to a national debt that already stands at $20 trillion. With the clock ticking toward a deadline of midnight on Friday when government funding would run out, Democrats in the House and Senate made a strong pitch for including protections for young immigrants who entered the country illegally as children, popularly known as â€œDreamers.â€ In the end, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and immigration advocacy groups failed. But nearly all of the Houseâ€™s 193 Democrats and 29 of the Senateâ€™s 46 Democrats voted no, in part to protest the lack of action on the immigration measure. Shortly before the House and Senate votes, Democratic Representative Luis Gutierrez told reporters, â€œWeâ€™re really tired of tomorrow,â€ referring to years of failed attempts in Congress to protect Dreamers from deportation, allow them to legally work in the United States and get on a path to citizenship. They will resume their fight in January, aiming to win on the next spending bill or a separate measure. Trump has eliminated Obama-era temporary protections for Dreamers, but has asked Congress to come up with a permanent solution by March. In the meantime, about 122 Dreamers a day are becoming vulnerable to deportation while Congress bickers. Also on Thursday, the Senate put the brakes on another bill that passed the House, which would provide $81 billion in new disaster aid to help Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and several states hit by this yearâ€™s hurricanes or wildfires. The temporary spending bill did, however, give Trump a modest increase of $4.7 billion for the Department of Defense to be used for missile defense and ship repair. The bill includes $2.85 billion to fund the Childrenâ€™s Health Insurance Program through March and funding for community health centers and the Indian Health Service. The plan also would extend the National Security Agencyâ€™s expiring internet surveillance program, known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, through Jan. 19. Other provisions address funding for veterans, the Coast Guard and flood insurance. Most government programs would be temporarily extended until Jan. 19 at fiscal 2017 levels.

Factbox: Big-ticket items at center of Congress spending bill,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Congress on Thursday approved a temporary funding bill to prevent federal agencies from shutting down at midnight Friday when existing money was set to expire. The following are the major items that were debated on the legislation that President Donald Trump is expected to sign into law: The Friday midnight deadline for action was the result of the Republican-controlled Congress failing to pass any of the regular appropriations bills for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. Instead, the government has been operating on a series of temporary measures. This newest stopgap bill continues funding for government operations through Jan. 19, giving lawmakers several weeks to work out a spending bill that would pay for agency activities through Sept. 30, the end of the current fiscal year.  House of Representatives conservatives failed in their bid to attach a major defense spending increase that would fund the Pentagon through September. Instead, Congress agreed to fund the military through Jan. 19, like most other programs. But in a move to attract support, a $4.7 billion increase was included to be used for missile defense and ship repair. Democrats and Republicans will continue negotiations on higher funding for both military and non-military programs. An $81 billion disaster aid bill was going to be attached to the government funding bill. Instead, the House approved it as a stand-alone bill, only to see the Senate put off action until at least next month. It would build on about $52 billion already provided to Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and several states hit by severe hurricanes, wildfires or other natural disasters. Democrats want to do more for Puerto Rico and some Republicans worry about the mounting costs of disaster aid. The Childrenâ€™s Health Insurance Program, which helps provide medical care to nearly 9 million children in low-income families, will get $2.85 billion to cover expenses through March as lawmakers seek a more permanent solution. Senators put off until early next year their bid to maintain healthcare subsidies for low-income people participating in the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Many House Republican lawmakers dislike the idea. The National Security Agencyâ€™s warrantless internet surveillance program under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act will be extended through Jan. 19 as lawmakers try to reconcile competing versions of such legislation in the House and Senate.  Legislation to protect â€œDreamersâ€ from deportation was not included, despite Democratsâ€™ push to resolve the issue by yearâ€™s end. It was a major disappointment for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and immigration advocacy groups. But negotiators are still trying to reach a deal on helping immigrants, many from Mexico and Central America, brought to the United States illegally as children. The issue is expected to come back to life in early 2018.   ",politicsNews,"December 21, 2017 ",Real
"In victory for Trump, judge tosses suit on foreign payments","NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge in New York on Thursday threw out a lawsuit that had accused President Donald Trump of violating the U.S. Constitution by accepting foreign payments through his hotels and other businesses, handing him a major victory on an issue that has dogged him since even before he took office in January. Though other lawsuits remain pending that make similar claims, the ruling by U.S. District Judge George Daniels is the first to weigh the merits of the U.S. Constitutionâ€™s anti-corruption provisions as they apply to Trump, a wealthy businessman who as president regularly visits his own hotels, resorts and golf clubs. In a 29-page opinion granting the Trump administrationâ€™s request to toss the suit, Daniels said the plaintiffs did not have legal standing to bring the suit. The plaintiffs included the nonprofit watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), a hotel owner, a hotel events booker and a restaurant trade group. The lawsuit, filed after the Republican president took office in January, accused Trump of running afoul of the Constitutionâ€™s â€œemolumentsâ€ clause by maintaining ownership of his business empire while in office.  The emoluments clause, designed to prevent corruption and foreign influence, bars U.S. officials from accepting gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval. Trump has ceded day-to-day control of his businesses to his sons. Critics have said that is not a sufficient safeguard. The plaintiffs said they are legally injured when foreign governments try to â€œcurry favorâ€ with Trump by paying to use his businesses, such as the Trump International Hotel in Washington or a high-end restaurant at a Trump hotel in New York City. The plaintiffs said this leads them to have lost patronage, wages and commissions. U.S. Department of Justice spokeswoman Lauren Ehrsam said the Trump administration â€œappreciates the courtâ€™s ruling.â€ Daniels, appointed to the bench by Democratic former President Bill Clinton, said in his decision that the plaintiffsâ€™ claims were speculative. Daniels said Trump had amassed wealth and fame even before taking office and was competing in the hospitality industry.  â€œIt is only natural that interest in his properties has generally increased since he became president,â€ the judge wrote. The judge also said that if Congress wanted to do something about the presidentâ€™s actions, it could. â€œCongress is not a potted plant,â€ Daniels said. â€œIt is a co-equal branch of the federal government with the power to act.â€ CREW Executive Director Noah Bookbinder said that his legal team is weighing options on how to proceed. â€œWhile todayâ€™s ruling is a setback, we will not walk away from this serious and ongoing constitutional violation,â€ Bookbinder added. Some legal experts had raised concerns even before his inauguration on Jan. 20 that Trump would violate the emoluments clause as president.  ",politicsNews,"December 21, 2017 ",Real
Senate shelves disaster aid bill until next month,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Legislation to provide $81 billion in new disaster aid for U.S. states, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands was put on hold by the Senate on Thursday amid attacks from both Republicans and Democrats. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives passed the legislation earlier on Thursday to help recovery efforts stemming from hurricanes and wildfires. But the Senate put off a vote until at least January, according to some lawmakers and aides, after Democrats complained Puerto Rico was not getting enough help and some fiscal hawks fretted about the overall cost.

House widens ethics probe to include Farenthold campaign work,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The ethics probe into U.S. Representative Blake Farenthold, who is already under a cloud for alleged sexual misconduct, is being expanded to look into whether he mixed his political campaign with congressional work and lied to the House Ethics Committee, the panel said on Thursday. Last week, Farenthold said he would not seek re-election next year after accounts surfaced that he created a hostile work environment. The Texas Republican denied allegations of sexual harassment but admitted allowing an unprofessional culture in his Capitol Hill office. On Thursday the ethics committee voted unanimously to investigate whether Farenthold used his congressional staff and other resources of the House of Representatives to further his political campaign, and if he had made false statements or omissions to the committee. The panel was already looking into whether he committed sexual harassment, discrimination and retaliation against a former staff member and if he made inappropriate statements to other members of his staff.  The committee said the announcement should not be read as an indication that it had found any rule violations. Farentholdâ€™s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Congress strictly divides lawmakersâ€™ work on Capitol Hill and their runs for re-election so that taxpayers do not end up subsidizing political campaigns. In August, the committee went so far as to warn Representatives, who face elections every two years, they should not even send texts or forward emails related to their campaigns while in House buildings. Congress is reviewing its workplace policies on sexual harassment after a number of lawmakers have been accused of sexual misconduct in recent weeks amid a wave of such allegations against powerful men in entertainment, politics and the media. A bipartisan group of lawmakers in the House said on Thursday intends to introduce legislation in January reforming a 20-year-old law that covers sexual harassment in Congress, which it hopes will pass soon after.

U.S. court rejects Trump bid to stop transgender military recruits on Jan. 1,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court in Virginia on Thursday rejected a bid by President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration to prevent the U.S. military from accepting transgender recruits starting Jan. 1. The administration had urged the appeals court to suspend an order by a federal judge in Baltimore for the armed forces to begin accepting transgender recruits on that date. The administration has said the Jan. 1 start date was causing the armed forces to scramble to revise their policies at the risk of harming military readiness.  In a brief two-paragraph order, the three-judge panel of the Richmond-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said it was denying the administrationâ€™s request while the appeal proceeds. All three judges are Democratic appointees.  The courtâ€™s action could prompt the administration to ask the conservative-majority U.S. Supreme Court to intervene. â€œWe disagree with the courtâ€™s ruling and are currently evaluating the next steps,â€ U.S. Justice Department spokeswoman Lauren Ehrsam said in a statement. Several transgender service members, backed by the American Civil Liberties Union, filed suit in Maryland after Trump said in July he would ban transgender people from the military, a move that would reverse a policy of the Republican presidentâ€™s Democratic predecessor Barack Obama to accept them. Trump cited concern over military focus and medical costs. So far, three federal judges around the country have issued injunctions blocking Trumpâ€™s ban. His administration has appealed all three rulings.  Joshua Block, an ACLU attorney who represents the plaintiffs in the Maryland case, said he was happy the appeals court saw through the governmentâ€™s â€œsmokescreenâ€ to further delay enlistment.  Thursdayâ€™s action was in response to the administrationâ€™s appeal of a Nov. 21 ruling by U.S. District Judge Marvin Garbis, who said that the transgender prohibition likely violates the plaintiffsâ€™ constitutional right to equal protection under the law. The Garbis ruling followed a similar one on Oct. 30 by another federal judge in Washington, D.C. A third judge in Seattle also ruled against the administration on Dec. 11. In an August memorandum, Trump gave the military until March 2018 to revert to a policy prohibiting openly transgender people from joining the military and authorizing their discharge. The memo also halted the use of government funds for sex-reassignment surgery for active-duty military personnel. The Obama administration had set a deadline of July 1 of this year to begin accepting transgender recruits. But Trumpâ€™s defense secretary, James Mattis, postponed that date to Jan. 1, which the presidentâ€™s ban then put off indefinitely. The Trump administration said in legal papers that the armed forces are not prepared to train thousands of personnel on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants and might have to accept â€œsome individuals who are not medically fit for service.â€ The Pentagon on Dec. 8 issued guidelines to recruitment personnel in order to enlist transgender applicants by Jan. 1. The memo outlined medical requirements and specified how the applicantsâ€™ sex would be identified and even which undergarments they would wear. The banâ€™s challengers said the memo contradicted the claim that the military was not ready.  The Justice Department disagreed, telling the court on Wednesday that â€œall this memorandum shows is that the military is scrambling to comply with the injunction.â€ The lawsuitâ€™s lead plaintiff Brock Stone, 34, has served in the U.S. Navy for 11 years, including a nine-month deployment to Afghanistan, and wants to remain for at least 20 years, according to court papers.

House Democrats rally to protect Special Counsel Mueller,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives rallied behind Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Thursday, after recent attempts by Republicans and conservative news outlets to discredit him and his probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. In a letter sent to Justice Department Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, 171 of the 193 Democrats in the House said they support Muellerâ€™s probe, and urged Rosenstein to let it continue â€œunfettered by political influence or threats to his authority.â€  â€œWe will not stand by and allow Fox News and right-wing Republicans to defy the rule of law and create their own rules to interfere with the legitimate investigation under the Constitution of the United States,â€ California Democrat Maxine Waters said during a press conference Thursday. â€œThere is an organized effort by Republicans ... to spin a false narrative and conjure up outrageous scenarios to accuse Special Counsel Mueller of being biased,â€ she added. Rosenstein appointed Mueller as Special Counsel in May, after President Donald Trump fired former FBI Director James Comey for what Trump later said was â€œthis Russia thing.â€ Critics promptly accused the president of trying to obstruct the probe. Mueller is investigating whether Trumpâ€™s presidential campaign colluded with Russia to interfere with the election. Russia has denied meddling and Trump has said there was no collusion.  Republican criticism of Mueller, himself a member of their party, has intensified in recent months since he charged four of Trumpâ€™s close associates, including former campaign manager Paul Manafort and former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. Republicans and talk show hosts on Fox News have accused Muellerâ€™s team and the Federal Bureau of Investigation of bias, citing issues including anti-Trump text messages exchanged between two FBI staffers who previously worked on Muellerâ€™s team. House Republicans have launched their own investigation into the FBIâ€™s handling of Hillary Clintonâ€™s emails, and questioned whether she received favorable treatment after no charges were brought. Recently, rumors have flown around Washington that Trump may be seeking to have Mueller fired. Trumpâ€™s lawyers have said that is not true. Rosenstein, also a Republican, oversees Muellerâ€™s team. He can only fire Mueller for good cause, and he told Congress last week he sees no legitimate basis for doing so. â€œThis investigation must continue unimpeded,â€ House Judiciary Committee Ranking Democrat Jerrold Nadler said Thursday. Nadler said Republicans were trying to â€œprovide cover for the President as the walls close in on him.â€ ",politicsNews,"December 21, 2017 ",Real
Second U.S. judge blocks Trump administration birth control rules,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A second U.S. judge on Thursday blocked President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration from enforcing new rules that undermine an Obamacare requirement for employers to provide insurance that covers womenâ€™s birth control. U.S. District Judge Haywood Gilliam Jr. in Oakland, California, said the federal government likely did not follow proper administrative procedures in promulgating the new rules, and put them on hold while a lawsuit challenging their legality proceeds. The decision followed a similar ruling from a federal judge in Philadelphia last Friday that blocked the administration from enforcing rules it announced in October allowing businesses or nonprofits to obtain exemptions on moral or religious grounds. Gilliam ruled on a lawsuit pursued by Democratic attorneys general in California, Delaware, Maryland, New York and Virginia. He said that a preliminary injunction was necessary given the â€œdire public health and fiscal consequencesâ€ that could result as a result of the administration adopting the rules without the input of interested parties. â€œIf the Court ultimately finds in favor of Plaintiffs on the merits, any harm caused in the interim by rescinded contraceptive coverage would not be susceptible to remedy,â€ he wrote. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement that, given last weekâ€™s decision in Pennsylvania, â€œtodayâ€™s ruling amounts to a one-two punch against the Trump administrationâ€™s unlawful overreach.â€ The U.S. Justice Department defended the rules in court.  Lauren Ehrsam, a department spokeswoman, said the agency disagreed with the ruling and was evaluating its next steps. â€œThis administration is committed to defending the religious liberty of all Americans and we look forward to doing so in court,â€ Ehrsam said in a statement. The lawsuit is among several that Democratic state attorneys general filed after the Republican Trump administration revealed the new rules on Oct. 6, which targeted the contraceptive mandate implemented as part of 2010â€™s Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. The rules will let businesses or nonprofits lodge religious or moral objections to obtain an exemption from the lawâ€™s mandate that employers provide contraceptive coverage in health insurance with no co-payment. Conservative Christian activists and congressional Republicans praised the move, while reproductive rights advocates and Democrats criticized it. ",politicsNews,"December 21, 2017 ",Real
Senators seek to stop expansion of airport facial scans,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two U.S. senators on Thursday urged federal authorities to halt the planned expansion of a $1 billion airport facial scanning program, saying the technology used to identify travelers on some flights departing from nine U.S. airports for international destinations may not be not accurate enough and raises privacy concerns. Congress has approved the use of the program for non-U.S. citizens, but never expressly authorized its use for Americans. The Department of Homeland Security has said the system is needed to prevent travelers from leaving the country using someone elseâ€™s identity and to prevent visitors to the United States from overstaying their visas. Senators Mike Lee, a Republican, and Edward Markey, a Democrat, in a letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, raised concerns that too many travelers would be inconvenienced by faulty scan results and questioned why Americans are being subjected to the screens, known as biometric exit detection technology.  In the letter, they raised objections to expanding the program beyond the nine airports where it is already in use. â€œWe request that DHS stop the expansion of this program and provide Congress with its explicit statutory authority to use and expand a biometric exit program on U.S. citizens,â€ the senators wrote. â€œIf there is no specific authorization, then we request an explanation for why DHS believes it has the authority to proceedâ€ They cited a report released Thursday by Georgetown University Law Schoolâ€™s Center on Privacy & Technology that found DHS is conducting the scans â€œwithout basic legal and technical safeguards - or any meaningful justification of its billion-dollar cost.â€ Congress in 2016 authorized spending up to $1 billion over 10 years on the facial scans. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), on its website, says the program collects â€œfacial images from all travelers from the United Statesâ€ on a flight and uses the images to verify identities. It says the images are stored for no more than two weeks and says that â€œCBP is dedicated to protecting the privacy of all travelers.â€ The government said Thursday that U.S. citizens may opt out of the facial screening and instead have a separate review of their ID documents. A U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokeswoman said the government is working to establish the biometric exit program â€œin a way thatâ€™s most efficient and secure for the traveler and that is least disruptive for the travel industry.â€ Airports using the system include Boston, Las Vegas, Miami, New Yorkâ€™s John F. Kennedy, Washington Dulles, both Houston airports, Chicago Oâ€™Hare and Atlanta. The senators want DHS to provide data that the program will not unduly burden travelers. DHS said previously its goal is a 96 percent â€œtrue accept rate,â€ meaning the technology can positively identify 96 percent of the faces it scans. The senators, however, said this meant â€œthere would still be a false denial for one in 25 travelers. Further there is evidence that certain face scans exhibit different error rate depending on the race or gender of the person being scanned.â€ DHS has said travelers who cannot be verified are escorted to another area where Customs and Border Patrol uses other methods to verify their identity. The Georgetown Law report also noted that DHS has not established any rules governing the program.  â€œItâ€™s as if DHS has hired a billion-dollar bouncer to check IDs but never checked how good he is at spotting a fake,â€ said Laura Moy, deputy director of the center and co-author of the report. â€œThey also donâ€™t know if heâ€™s biased against certain groups of people.â€ The senators said DHS also needed safeguards to ensure facial data is not shared with other U.S. agencies.

U.S. launches effort to reduce reliance on imports or critical minerals,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke on Thursday launched an effort to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign supplies of critical minerals used in smartphones, computers and military equipment, which he said poses a national security and economic risk. Under a directive from President Donald Trump, Zinke will  work with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to publish in 60 days a list of non-fuel minerals that are vulnerable to supply chain disruptions and necessary for manufacturing and will develop a strategy to lessen U.S. dependence on foreign suppliers. The policy would aim to identify new domestic sources of critical minerals; increase domestic exploration, mining and  recycling; giving miners and producers electronic access to better mapping and geological data; and streamlining leasing and permitting for new mines. â€œThe United States must not remain reliant on foreign competitors like Russia and China for the critical minerals needed to keep our economy strong and our country safe,â€ Trump said. The order comes after the Interior Department and the U.S. Geological Survey published a report earlier this week that detailed U.S. dependence on foreign competitors for its supply of certain minerals. The report identified 23 out of 88 minerals that are priorities for U.S. national defense and the economy because they are components in products ranging from batteries to military equipment. The list included rare earths metals, lithium, graphite and other minerals.  That report did not offer policy recommendations, but Zinke said he would rely on the findings as he prioritizes research into certain mineral deposit areas on federal land and plans policies to promote mining. Twenty of the 23 critical minerals that the United States relies on are sourced from China. Much of the worldâ€™s lithium is produced in Australia and Chile, with the bulk of the worldâ€™s reserves straddling huge salt flats in the so-called lithium triangle of Chile, Bolivia and Argentina.  Lithium exports from Chile, for example, approached $600 million in 2016, or roughly 40 percent of the global market by volume, according to Chile development agency Corfo. Lithium producers SQM, Albemarle and FMC Lithium are among the regionâ€™s top producers. ",politicsNews,"December 21, 2017 ",Real

U.S. lawmakers release sample of Russian-bought Facebook ads,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers released a batch of Russian-bought Facebook Inc ads on Wednesday that showcased politically charged content allegedly spread on social media by Moscow ahead of the 2016 U.S. election.  Some of the ads criticized candidates, while others sought to organize or promote simultaneous rallies for opposite sides of divisive issues. The sample posted on a House committee website pulled from the roughly 3,000 ads Facebook provided to congressional investigators last month.  Tech companies recently acknowledged that Russia-based content on U.S. politics and social issues like gun rights, immigration, religion and race had spread on their platforms before and after the election. Some of the ads sampled specifically dealt with the U.S. election and were critical of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. One from an account called â€œArmy of Jesusâ€ said Clinton was supported by evil forces. â€œHillary is a Satan, and her crimes and lies had proved just how evil she is,â€ the post read. It added that Republican candidate Donald Trump was â€œan honest manâ€ who â€œcares deeply for this country.â€ Other ads appeared to be aimed at setting up clashes over hot-button issues.  One ad from a group calling itself â€œHeart of Texasâ€ promoted a rally in Houston on May 21, 2016 to â€œStop Islamizationâ€ in the U.S. state. Another ad from a separate Facebook page promoted a pro-Islam rally at the same time and venue. The Russian government has denied any attempts to sway the 2016 election, in which U.S. President Donald Trump defeated Clinton. The ads were released at a U.S. House Intelligence Committee hearing, where lawyers from Facebook, Twitter Inc and Alphabet Incâ€™s Google testified about Russian influence on their networks.  It was the second straight day the companies attempted to ward off criticism from lawmakers that they were slow to respond to Russian abuse. Facebook, the worldâ€™s largest social media network, again came under the most scrutiny from lawmakers, who expressed frustration with the company because of its role in targeted marketing.  Facebook General Counsel Colin Stretch told the committee that 16 million Americans may have been exposed to Russian information on Facebookâ€™s picture-sharing service Instagram beginning in October 2016. The election was on Nov. 8. An additional four million may have seen such material on Instagram before October, though that data was less complete, Stretch said. The Instagram figures were in addition to the 126 million Americans who may have seen Russian-backed political content on Facebook over a two-year period, a number the company disclosed earlier this week. The companiesâ€™ visit to Washington this week reflected shifting political fortunes for the U.S. tech industry, which after decades of relatively little regulatory scrutiny is now on the defensive on a range of policy issues. â€œIn the past election, you failed,â€ said Democratic Senator Ron Wyden, who normally is considered a strong ally of Silicon Valley. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered in the campaign, including through social media, to try to influence the vote in favor of Trump.  A U.S. Justice Department special counsel and several congressional panels are investigating Russian meddling and any potential collusion by Trumpâ€™s campaign.  Trump has said there was no collusion with Moscow ahead of the election. Democrats and Republicans both said in Wednesdayâ€™s Senate intelligence hearing that the tech companies need to do more to police against foreign government abuse on their platforms. Some Republicans, however, sought to distance that scrutiny from questions about the legitimacy of Trumpâ€™s election victory. Richard Burr, the Republican chairman of the panel, said it was impossible to measure the impact or know the motivation of the Russian operation to spread political material on social media.  Any conclusions that Trump benefited from Russia, perhaps in a decisive way, to win the White House ignored the complexity of the issue, Burr said. â€œIâ€™m here to tell you this story does not simplify that easily,â€ he said. Some Republicans also sought to portray the amount of Russian content as miniscule compared to the total amount of political material online.  The campaigns of Trump and Clinton spent a combined $81 million on Facebook ads, Stretch said, compared to about $46,000 in ad buys from the Internet Research Agency, a suspected Russian troll farm. Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the panel, said he was disappointed the companies appeared be confining reviews to information linked to the Internet Research Agency, and suggested there could have been far more undetected Russian content. Some senators criticized the companies for sending lawyers, not chief executives, to testify.  â€œIf we go through this exercise again, we would appreciate seeing the top people who are making the decision,â€ said Senator Angus King, an independent.

"In meeting, Trump to push a reluctant Xi to rein in North Korea","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump will further pressure Chinese President Xi Jinping in talks next week to take tougher measures against North Korea, as the United States compiles information for possible new sanctions on Chinese banks working with Pyongyang. Senior administration officials say Trump will try to convince Xi when they meet in Beijing to squeeze North Korea with steps such as limits on oil exports, coal imports and financial transactions. It is the latest attempt by Trump to have China, North Koreaâ€™s only major ally, rein in Pyongyangâ€™s nuclear weapons ambitions but it is far from clear if Xi, who has just consolidated his power at a Communist Party congress, will agree. China says its leverage over Pyongyang is exaggerated, and points to its support in the U.N. Security Council for recent sanctions on North Korea as evidence that it is trying to curtail the isolated nationâ€™s nuclear and missile tests.     North Korea this year conducted a powerful nuclear test detonation and has test-fired intercontinental ballistic missiles that, if perfected, could reach the U.S. mainland. Trump has vowed to prevent North Korea gaining that capability. Two U.S. officials said the threat of additional U.N. and other economic sanctions on North Korea is another option to solicit greater cooperation from China, by playing on Beijingâ€™s concerns that deeper poverty in North Korea could prompt an exodus of refugees across its border. The officials said the United States and its allies have been collecting detailed information on Chinese bank transactions with North Korea to try to identify institutions with the â€œmost egregiousâ€ records of doing business with Pyongyang. The objective, the officials said, is to craft a proposal for escalating sanctions on Chinese financial and other entities that stops short of sanctioning the Peopleâ€™s Bank of China central bank. Washington so far has mostly held off on new sanctions against Chinese banks and companies doing business with North Korea, given fears of retaliation by Beijing and possibly far-reaching effects on the world economy. In a brief statement on Thursday formally announcing the visit from the Chinese end, the countryâ€™s foreign ministry said China was ready to work with the United States to achieve â€œimportant resultsâ€ for Trumpâ€™s visit. It did not elaborate.   Trumpâ€™s stop in Beijing is part of a Nov. 3-14 tour of five Asian nations in which North Korea will be a major focus. The visit includes U.S. allies Japan and South Korea who have watched with increasing worry as the United States and North Korea have exchanged bellicose rhetoric.     To prepare for his trip, Trump met with former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, a key player in President Richard Nixonâ€™s opening to China in 1972.  And over lunch last week at the White House, Trump asked Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong for his opinion about North Korea and its unpredictable leader, a participant said. Lee told him that Kim sees his nuclear weapons program as essential to his survival after the U.S.-led ouster of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, and Libyan leader Muammar Gaddhafiâ€™s downfall. â€œLee said itâ€™s probably impossible for Kim to become convinced that the United States doesnâ€™t want to overthrow him,â€ a participant at the lunch said. â€œTheyâ€™re super-paranoid.â€                     While part of the U.S. strategy on North Korea is to deprive Kim Jong Unâ€™s government of resources, Trump has left open the threat of military force. U.S. officials, while emphasizing they want a diplomatic solution, have highlighted military preparedness to counter a North Korean threat and there are three U.S. aircraft carrier groups in the region. Trump has threatened to â€œtotally destroyâ€ North Korea and has derided Kim as a â€œRocket Manâ€ on a suicide mission, to the dismay of some U.S. military and intelligence officials who fear such rhetoric could backfire.      As well as pressuring China, the United States is quietly pursuing direct diplomacy with North Korea, using a â€œNew York channelâ€ to get in contact with diplomats at Pyongyangâ€™s United Nations mission.  Analysts in Asia are skeptical Trumpâ€™s pressure on China will work. â€œI donâ€™t think China will seriously change its existing policy on North Korea simply because of more pressure from the United States,â€ said Zhao Tong, a North Korea expert at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center in Beijing.     Chinaâ€™s ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, told reporters on Monday it will take a broad effort to pressure North Korea and China alone cannot solve the problem. â€œChina has been doing everything we can on the Korean issue,â€ he said. In Japan, the threat from Pyongyang hit close to home after tests this year in which two ballistic missiles flew over its territory. But there is concern in Tokyo that the Trump administration lacks a clear North Korea strategy. â€œThe biggest worry is that Trumpâ€™s grand Asia policy, North Korea policy, is not well defined... but responds to circumstances instead... ,â€ said Toshihiro Nayakama, a professor at Keio University. â€œThey turn to China to exert pressure but the question is to what extent there is Chinese pressure. I believe this is not yet evaluated by the U.S. administration,â€ he said. The Trump administration has considered threatening China with trade actions over its resistance to do more on North Korea. While some advisers from outside his administration have  urged Trump to pursue this course, he has been persuaded against it by his own advisers who have warned of a trade war, U.S. officials said.

"After delay, Republicans in Congress prepare to introduce tax bill","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives were expected on Thursday to release a tax bill offering plenty of flexibility, as they grapple with stubborn internal disagreements on paying for the tax cuts they propose. After an embarrassing one-day postponement of the billâ€™s unveiling on Wednesday, lawmakers have made plans for a measure that will seek up to $6 trillion in tax cuts over 10 years but likely not spell out completely how to offset them. Asked if the bill would contain a permanent corporate tax rate cut to 20 percent from 35 percent, U.S. House of Representatives tax panel Chairman Kevin Brady told reporters: â€œThatâ€™s our goal and I think itâ€™s going to take several steps ... to achieve that.â€ Lobbyists said Republicans were having trouble reaching consensus on where to find revenue to pay for tax cuts and would likely have to make the corporate cut temporary as a result.  After a White House meeting with advisers, President Donald Trump told reporters: â€œSometime tomorrow, weâ€™ll be announcing massive tax cuts and reform.â€ House Republican leaders and tax panel members were slated to meet with Trump in the White House on Thursday afternoon. From mortgage interest and 401(k) retirement plans to the federal deficit and state and local taxes, numerous unanswered questions swirled around the tax-cut plan as lawmakers met into the evening on Capitol Hill. Representative Tom MacArthur, asked if fellow Republicans could meet their ambitious deadline of approving a tax bill by the Nov. 23 Thanksgiving holiday, told reporters: â€œIâ€™ve been called a lot of things but â€˜prophetâ€™ is not one of them.â€ Since taking over Congress and the White House in January, the Republicans and Trump have yet to score a major legislative accomplishment. That will change, they say, when they overhaul the tax code for the first time in 31 years. But they are fast discovering why every attempt to do that has failed since former Republican President Ronald Reaganâ€™s historic tax reform in 1986. Unlike the nearly three-year Reagan effort involving public hearings and bipartisan cooperation, the Trump tax plan was developed in secret over a few months by six senior lawmakers and White House advisers who took little input from rank-and-file Republicans and largely ignored the Democrats. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement that the â€œchaotic delayâ€ of the tax billâ€™s release showed Republicans were â€œpushing a half-baked tax bill with ruinous consequences for workers and middle-class Americans.â€ MacArthur said the planâ€™s biggest challenge was a proposed elimination of a deduction for state and local tax (SALT) payments, which is among several revenue-raising changes meant to offset proposed tax cuts. Other lawmakers and lobbyists cited different concerns with the bill.. Republicans from high-tax states where upper-middle-class voters would be hardest hit by the SALT deduction repeal were unsure if the bill on Thursday would address their concerns. Representative Lee Zeldin from New York said he wanted â€œmajor changesâ€ to preserve state and local tax deductibility. â€œI was encouraged when I heard Chairman Brady refer to the draft thatâ€™s about to get released as not being the final text,â€ said Zeldin. MacArthur, from New Jersey, said a compromise proposal being worked on to maintain and cap the deductibility of property tax payments was a good start but the cap would need to be raised to earn his support. Trump, largely playing cheerleader in the debate, tweeted advice on paying for the cuts. â€œWouldnâ€™t it be great to Repeal the very unfair and unpopular Individual Mandate in ObamaCare and use those savings for further Tax Cuts,â€ he said in a Twitter post. Afterward, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters that the administration still wanted to repeal and replace Obamacare, but â€œwe still think itâ€™s probably more likely to do something like that in the spring.â€ An attempt to dismantle former Democratic President Barack Obamaâ€™s Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, failed dramatically in the Republican-controlled Senate in July. 401(k) IN PLAY Another contentious revenue-raising proposal in the plan is to limit how much money Americans can put into their 401(k) retirement accounts and individual retirement accounts (IRAs) on a pre-tax basis. There was also a proposal to limit the deductibility of interest payments by businesses. Restrictions are opposed by businesses with little access to equity financing, including farmers, ranchers and small businesses. A rough framework of the tax plan was unveiled in late September, but its basic components were changing. It originally called for reducing the number of tax brackets to three from seven, with the current top tax rate of 39.6 percent reduced to 35 percent, a win for high-income taxpayers. Partly in response to Democrats who dismissed the plan as a giveaway to corporations and the wealthy, lawmakers are expected to restore a fourth 39.6 percent tax bracket but increase the income level where it applies, perhaps to $1 million, more than double the current level. Questions remained about the original frameworkâ€™s proposal to repeal the estate tax on inheritances, another policy change that would favor wealthy Americans. Discussion was ongoing about possibly phasing it out.    Lawmakers also have not resolved a challenge posed by Trumpâ€™s plan to lower the tax rate on pass-through enterprises, such as partnerships and sole proprietorships, to 25 percent from as high as 39.6 percent, they said.

"Trump calls for ending visa program after N.Y. attack, blasts Democrats","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Wednesday seized on the deadly New York City truck attack to step up demands for stricter U.S. immigration laws, asking Congress to end a visa program that let the Uzbek suspect into the country and saying he might send him to Guantanamo Bay. In a day of harsh recriminations over Tuesdayâ€™s attack that killed eight people in Americaâ€™s largest city, Trump appeared to assign some blame for an incident that authorities have labeled as terrorism to top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer, who accused Trump of politicizing a national tragedy.  Trump said he would consider sending the suspect, identified by authorities as Sayfullo Saipov, to the military prison at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, which his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama tried but failed to shut. No detainee has been sent to the Guantanamo prison since 2008. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders later told reporters that Trump considers Saipov an â€œenemy combatant,â€ a designation that would curtail his legal rights. Trump called the suspect â€œthis animalâ€ and lambasted the U.S. justice system for terrorism suspects as â€œa jokeâ€ and â€œa laughingstock.â€ Since taking office in January, Trump has sought to increase deportations of illegal immigrations and limit legal immigration. The Department of Homeland Security said Saipov entered the United States in 2010 through the so-called diversity visa program, designed to provide a path to U.S. residency for citizens from countries with historically low rates of immigration to the United States. Authorities said Saipov drove a rented truck along a bike path in lower Manhattan, mowing down cyclists and pedestrians. Police shot and wounded Saipov before arresting him. Trump reprised what has been his stance as a White House candidate and as president - that tougher immigration laws should be a first line of defense against such attacks. â€œIâ€™m going to ask Congress to immediately initiate work to get rid of this program,â€ Trump told reporters at the White House.  â€œWe have to get much tougher,â€ he said. â€œWe have to get much smarter. And we have to get much less politically correct. Weâ€™re so politically correct that weâ€™re afraid to do anything.â€ Schumer helped create the diversity visa program in 1990 when he in the House of Representatives, but he was also part of a bipartisan group of lawmakers who crafted an immigration bill in 2013 that would have done away with the program. That bill was passed by the Senate but killed by the Republican-led House. The program, via a lottery, selects up to 50,000 people per year who receive U.S. visas, and eventually permanent residence in the United States. Those selected undergo U.S. security checks before being allowed to immigrate. â€œThe terrorist came into our country through what is called the â€˜Diversity Visa Lottery Program,â€™ a Chuck Schumer beauty. I want merit based,â€ Trump wrote on Twitter. Sanders said later that Trump does not blame Schumer for the attack and would â€œloveâ€ to work with the senator on tougher immigration laws. Trump on Wednesday also renewed his call for a â€œmerit-basedâ€ visa system - which would favor the highly skilled - and for ending â€œchain migration,â€ which allows legal immigrants to apply for relatives abroad to come to the United States. Trump said there were â€œ23 people that came in or potentially came inâ€ with Saipov. Asked if legislation to end the visa program would be taken up, No. 2 Senate Republican John Cornyn told reporters that Congress must first pass legislation to protect illegal immigrants brought into the country as children, â€œand then the next thing we need to do is turn to our legal immigration system and see how we can change it.â€ Trump accused congressional Democrats of blocking immigration legislation that would make the nation safer. â€œWe have a lot of good bills in there. Weâ€™re being stopped by Democrats because theyâ€™re obstructionists. And honestly, they donâ€™t want to do whatâ€™s right for our country,â€ Trump said. Both the Senate and the House are controlled by Trumpâ€™s fellow Republicans. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham criticized the Trump administration for not declaring Saipov, who remained hospitalized after being shot in the abdomen by a police officer on Tuesday, as an â€œenemy combatant.â€ â€œItâ€™s ridiculous to believe that one day of interviews in a hospital tells us all we need to know about Saipovâ€™s terrorist ties,â€ Graham said in a statement. The complaint filed against Saipov said he had waived his rights and agreed to speak to investigators without an attorney present. As a presidential candidate, Trump called for a total ban on Muslims entering the country as a counter-terrorism measure. Courts have blocked his latest executive action barring entry into the United States by people from several Muslim-majority countries. Sanders said the White House has not ruled out adding Uzbekistan to the list of countries named in the travel ban. In a speech on the Senate floor, Schumer said that â€œinstead of politicizing and dividing America, which he always seems to do at times of national tragedy, (Trump) should be bringing us together and focusing on the real solution, anti-terrorism funding, which he proposed to cut in his most recent budget.â€ ",politicsNews,"November 1, 2017 ",Real
House questions FEMA over Puerto Rico power contracts,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representativesâ€™ energy committee on Wednesday said it wants the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to explain how it is overseeing contracts for rebuilding Puerto Ricoâ€™s power grid after it was devastated by Hurricane Maria. In a letter to FEMA, the committee raised questions about contracts between Puerto Ricoâ€™s Electric Power Authority (PREPA) and two companies: Whitefish Energy Holdings and Cobra Acquisitions LLC, a subsidiary of Mammoth Energy Services Inc. Six weeks after the hurricane swept across the island, two-thirds of its residents are still without electricity. Washington is preparing to spend billions on relief for the territory, home to 3.4 million Americans, with assistance for the grid seen as one of the most expensive and complex pieces of the aid. The House Energy and Commerce committee - one of several panels of lawmakers keeping a close eye on Puerto Rico projects - said in its letter that â€œfederal leadership and strategic coordinationâ€ are needed to restore power, and outlined a series of concerns about the role played so far by FEMA. Usually, power utilities seek help from other utility companies to restore power immediately after disasters. But Puerto Rico first turned to contractors, as utilities were leery about getting paid by PREPA, which declared bankruptcy in July. On Sunday, Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rossello and PREPA said they would cancel a $300 million contract with Whitefish Energy Holdings, after a controversy over the dealâ€™s provisions and the Montana companyâ€™s lack of experience with projects of such a large size. The committee said it was concerned about FEMAâ€™s oversight of the Whitefish contract. â€œWe have a contract with PREPA, and how PREPA and FEMA are interacting, that is PREPAâ€™s issue,â€ a spokesman for Whitefish said in a statement. Lawmakers also questioned provisions in a PREPA contract issued to Cobra Acquisitions, including â€œlanguage which would appear to have the effect of preventing government oversight of the agreement.â€ In a statement, Cobra said its managers met with PREPA at its command center and â€œdescribed the companyâ€™s experience, ability to mobilize quickly and its plan to aid in the restoration of power to the island. We also met with representatives of FEMA, the Army Corps of Engineers and other key agencies.â€ FEMA asked the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Sept. 30 to take on an extra role in emergency repairs of the grid because of the scope of the damage. The Army Corps has awarded some of its own contracts and is boosting its presence. The lawmakers asked FEMA to brief its staff by Nov. 15. The agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. FEMA Administrator Brock Long testified to a Senate committee on Tuesday that the agency was not notified until â€œseveral weeks after the factâ€ that PREPA had contracted with Whitefish, and had not agreed to the contract language. â€œNot one dollar has gone toward that contract from FEMA,â€ Long said, telling senators that the agency is making sure PREPA has not asked for reimbursement for the work. Long told senators that FEMAâ€™s coordinator on the island has asked PREPA to â€œmake sure that we are unified with the Army Corps so weâ€™re not working in separate streams, but weâ€™re working together in a consolidated effort.â€ ",politicsNews,"November 1, 2017 ",Real
Factbox: What is in Republican tax bill? Here is the framework,"(Reuters) - Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives are due to release tax legislation on Thursday calling for slashing taxes on corporations, repealing some taxes paid primarily by the wealthy and adjusting other taxes on families and individuals.  As questions about the final shape of the bill swirl around Washington, the following is a look at the basic features of the plan released in September, though changes are expected: * Reduce the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from a current statutory 35 percent. * Eliminate the corporate alternative minimum tax. * Move to a territorial tax system that no longer imposes the U.S. corporate tax on foreign profits of U.S. companies. * Require U.S. corporations to return assets held overseas at lowered one-time tax rates. * Establish a minimum global tax aimed at the overseas profits of U.S. corporations to prevent tax base erosion. â€œPASS-THROUGHâ€ BUSINESSES * Limit the maximum tax rate on small businesses and other non-corporate enterprises to 25 percent, down from the present maximum rate on â€œpass-throughâ€ income of 39.6 percent. * Allow immediate and full expensing of capital investments for at least five years. * Partially limit the business tax deduction for debt interest payments. * Cut the top individual rate to 35 percent from 39.6 percent. * Increase the standard deduction for taxpayers to $12,000 from $6,300 for individuals, and to $24,000 from $12,600 for married couples. * Reduce the current seven individual income tax brackets to three brackets of 12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent. * Consider a fourth bracket at a rate higher than 35 percent for high-income Americans to prevent shifting the overall tax burden from higher- to lower-income households. * Partially repeal the deduction for state and local tax payments. * Eliminate the $4,050 personal exemption for taxpayers and family members. * Create a â€œsubstantialâ€ increase in the child tax credit, now $1,000; raise the income limit to qualify for the credit; and eliminate the higher qualifying income rate for married couples. * Create a $500 tax credit for taxpayers with non-child dependents. * Repeal the individual alternative minimum tax on high-income taxpayers. * Repeal the estate tax paid chiefly by the richest Americans.

"Factbox: Trump tax plan stumbles on local tax deduction, 401(k)","(Reuters) - The rollout of a tax-cut plan being promoted by U.S. President Donald Trump and senior congressional Republicans was delayed on Wednesday as groups of lawmakers and special interests dug in on key provisions, insisting on changes. Here are some of the most contentious issues in the tax debate, which likely will play out over the coming weeks and months before it can garner enough support to pass Congress and be sent to Trump to sign into law. 401(k). Republicans are eyeing new limits on how much money Americans can pump each year into their 401(k) retirement accounts on a pre-tax basis. Lower limits for tax-free contributions would produce new revenue to help Republicans pay for tax cuts they have proposed for high-income earners, corporations and wealthy familiesâ€™ inheritances. Taxpayers now can channel $18,000 of income tax-free into 401(k)s. Republican tax writers initially proposed lowering that cap to $2,400 and, after pushback, that number has been in flux. Firms that manage 401(k) plans, Wall Street firms that execute trades for them and the 54 million Americans who have 401(k) accounts could be hurt by such a change. Mortgages. Americans can now deduct mortgage interest from their incomes if they itemize deductions. The plan does not call for changing that directly but it does call for doubling the standard deduction, a separate tax return line that determines eligibility for itemizing. Doubling that would mean fewer Americans itemizing - and fewer deducting mortgage interest. Critics say doubling the standard deduction would make the mortgage-interest deduction a benefit for only higher-income taxpayers. The National Association of Home Builders has declared opposition to the Republican plan and proposed creating a new, non-itemized tax credit for mortgage interest. SALT. A proposal to eliminate a popular tax deduction for state and local tax (SALT) payments has threatened to derail the Republican plan. Democratic and Republican lawmakers from high-tax states, such as New York, California and New Jersey, oppose this change because it would hit their constituents hardest. Real estate interests have fought for an exemption of state and local property taxes, which is expected to make it into the bill, with a cap. Some SALT-state Republicans say they would be satisfied with an adequate property-tax deduction; others have said they will push to preserve income-tax deductibility. Pass-throughs. Republicans want to cut the tax rate for â€œpass-throughâ€ businesses, such as partnerships and sole proprietorships, to 25 percent from as high as 39.6 percent. Winners from this would include many pass-throughs that are small mom-and-pop businesses but it would also benefit big enterprises, such as hedge funds and real estate partnerships. Losers would be upper middle-class wage-earners unable to channel their incomes through pass-through structures. Some tax experts warn slashing the pass-through rate could unleash new tax-dodging schemes to enable Americans to do just that: run their personal incomes through pass-through structures such as partnerships, corporations and sole proprietorships. Tax negotiators are examining ways to limit what types of professional partnerships would qualify for a new pass-through rate. They also are weighing a proposal to limit the new rate to only 30 percent of business income. Business interest. Another change being evaluated by Republicans is ending or further restricting tax deductibility of business interest. This would mean business borrowers could no longer write off the interest they pay on debts. Businesses have formed a group, called the BUILD Coalition, to oppose the provision. Members include Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N), Owens-Illinois (OI.N), S&P Global (SPGI.N) and lobbying groups for private equity firms, farmers, mortgage bankers, real estate investment trusts, casinos and equipment leasing groups. Tax writers are looking at ways to exempt small businesses and allow them to continue to deduct business interest on debts. Deficit. Not long ago, most Republicans stood firmly against increasing the federal budget deficit and the national debt but analysts say their tax plan would hugely expand both. Washington was expected to collect $3.3 trillion in taxes in 2017 but spend $4 trillion, leaving a deficit of $700 billion. Previous deficits have piled up a national debt of $20 trillion. The Trump tax-cut plan would reduce federal tax revenues by $2.4 trillion in the first 10 years and by $3.4 trillion in the 10 years after that, adding greatly to the deficit and the debt, according to the Tax Policy Center, a non-partisan think tank. The plan would give a small economic boost but soon be overwhelmed by the rising federal debt burden, the center said. Helping the rich. The tax plan has struggled since it was unveiled as a rough framework in September with criticism from Democrats and social activists, who say it is a giveaway to the wealthy and corporations that hurts or neglects others. On that issue, the Tax Policy Center study said, â€œIn 2018, all income groups would see their average taxes fall, but some taxpayers in each group would face tax increases. Those with the very highest incomes would receive the biggest tax cuts.â€ ",politicsNews,"November 1, 2017 ",Real
"Tech companies join support of 'Dreamers,' challenging Trump","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Incâ€™s Google and Facebook Inc on Wednesday joined a legal challenge by more than 100 tech companies against a decision to end protection for so-called â€˜Dreamerâ€™ immigrants, the companies told Reuters. A legal briefing was filed Wednesday afternoon on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which protects immigrants brought into the United States illegally as children from deportation and which the Trump administration has decided to scrap. Tech firms argue that such immigrants are vital to the U.S. economy and that ending the program will hit growth. The filing is in support of a lawsuit filed by California Attorney General Xavier Becerra in the Northern District of California, according to the filing. Tech companies signed on to the amicus brief - a supporting document in a case, submitted by interested parties - also included Airbnb, Microsoft Corp, Salesforce.com Inc, Lyft, Uber [UBER.UL] and Twitter Inc. Becerra filed an additional motion on Wednesday that seeks to put a block on the withdrawal of DACA. That was supported by iPhone maker Apple Inc. â€œApple will be harmed significantly if it can no longer benefit from the hard work, creativity, and intelligence of its employees with DACA status,â€ said Deirdre Oâ€™Brien, Appleâ€™s vice president of people, in a filing supporting the motion. Apple employs more than 250 DACA recipients, the filing said.  The lawsuit challenges Trumpâ€™s September decision to rescind DACA, which was established by former President Barack Obama in 2012. It is set to expire in March. â€œDACAâ€™s rescission will inflict serious harm on U.S. companies, all workers, and the American economy as a whole,â€ the filing reads, according to a draft of the amicus brief provided by one of the companies.  A week ago, dozens of tech companies, including Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook Inc, Amazon.com Inc and others, formed The Coalition for the American Dream, a group calling for bipartisan legislation this year that would give illegal immigrants a path to permanent residency. Reuters was first to report that the coalition was being formed. About 900,000 immigrants have been shielded from deportation since the DACA program began. ",politicsNews,"November 1, 2017 ",Real
U.S. 'diversity visa' program in spotlight after New York attack,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A visa program aimed at diversifying the U.S. immigrant population came under attack from President Donald Trump on Wednesday after he learned that the man accused of killing eight people in New York City on Tuesday used it to enter the country.        Sayfullo Saipov, who was charged in Tuesdayâ€™s truck attack, immigrated to the United States from Uzbekistan in 2010 after winning a lottery enabling him to obtain a so-called â€œdiversity visa,â€ two government officials confirmed to Reuters.  The program, established by Congress and coordinated by the State Department, has its roots in efforts to bring more Irish and Italian immigrants into the United States. Citizens of countries that send relatively few immigrants to the United States can enter a lottery that grants winners permanent U.S. residency. Applicants must have at least a high school education or its equivalent, or relevant work experience. Just under 11.4 million applicants entered the 2016 lottery for 50,000 slots available to winners and their close family members, according to State Department figures. The visa program has succeeded in diversifying the mix of immigrants that come into the United States each year, but has also drawn criticism for being vulnerable to fraud and for posing national security risks. Trump said on Wednesday he would ask Congress to â€œimmediatelyâ€ initiate efforts to kill the program, and Republican House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, who has long called for an end to diversity visas, said in a statement that they pose â€œa threat to the safety of our citizens.â€ Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer helped create the program in 1990 when he was a member of the House of Representatives. But he was also part of a group of lawmakers in 2013 who crafted a bipartisan immigration bill that would have done away with the program. That bill was passed by the Senate but was killed by the Republican-led House. Top congressional Democrats on Wednesday defended the program, saying it subjects all visa recipients â€œto the same stringent vetting as all other immigrant visa programs.â€ The only other known instance of a diversity visa beneficiary carrying out a deadly terrorist attack in the United States occurred in 2002. That year, an Egyptian man who had received a diversity visa through his wife years earlier shot and killed two people in a Los Angeles airport. The man had earlier sought asylum in the United States but was rejected. Ultimately, he was allowed to stay in the country after his wife won the lottery. As early as 2004, the State Departmentâ€™s then-deputy inspector general, Anne Patterson, told Congress her office believed the diversity program â€œcontains significant vulnerabilities to national securityâ€ and that terrorists could â€œattempt to use it to enter the United States as permanent residents.â€ The agency watchdog recommended barring citizens of countries that sponsor terrorism from the program. Over the years, government audits have exposed sophisticated fraud schemes targeting the program, including extortion rackets, sham marriages and the use of fake identification documents.  In 2007, Congressâ€™s Government Accountability Office issued a report noting that federal law enforcers â€œbelieve that some individuals, including terrorists and criminals, could use fraudulent means to enter or remain in the United States.â€  The report found, however, â€œno documented evidenceâ€ that diversity visa immigrants â€œposed a terrorist or other threat.â€  A September 2013 State Department inspector general report found that â€œorganized fraud rings masquerading as travel agenciesâ€ had hijacked the diversity visa program in Ukraine. Under the scheme, Ukrainians were entered in the lottery without their consent, and then held up for money in exchange for the chance to claim a visa or encouraged to enter into sham marriages if they won.

U.S. lawmakers reach agreement on new North Korea sanctions,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican and Democratic U.S. senators on Wednesday said they agreed on a new package of sanctions on North Korea, and that the Senate Banking Committee would act on the legislation next week, while President Donald Trump is on his first trip to Asia since taking office. Among other measures, the â€œOtto Warmbier Banking Restrictions Involving North Korea Act of 2017,â€ named after a U.S. student who died after he was imprisoned in North Korea, would strengthen and expand existing sanctions and strengthen Congressâ€™ oversight of North Korea sanctions. It would also impose sanctions on foreign financial institutions, such as Chinese banks found to provide services to any individual targeted for North Korea-related sanctions by the U.S. Congress, a presidential executive order or U.N. Security Council resolution. The new sanctions bill would require Trump, or any other U.S. president, to notify congressional committees of any intention to terminate or suspend the sanctions. It would also require the president to submit regular reports on the system for licensing transactions and regular briefings for Congress by the administration. The international community has been working to come up with a response to North Koreaâ€™s nuclear and ballistic missiles programs that does not involve potentially catastrophic military action. Members of the U.S. Congress in particular have called for China, and Chinese banks, to do more to clamp down on Pyongyang. North Korea this year conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear detonation and has test-fired a volley of missiles, including intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that, if perfected, could potentially reach the U.S. mainland. The sanctions bill was agreed upon by Republican Senator Mike Crapo, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, and Sherrod Brown, its ranking member, along with panel members Pat Toomey, a Republican, and Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat. â€œThe time has come for the U.S. to take the lead to ensure that all nations work together to isolate the Kim regime until it has no choice but to change its dangerous, belligerent behavior,â€ Crapo said in a statement.

Trump does not recall suggestion of Putin meeting: White House,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump does not recall a meeting with his foreign policy advisers in March 2016 in which one of them suggested he could arrange a meeting between candidate Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the White House said on Wednesday. George Papadopoulos, an obscure Trump campaign adviser, pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents about contacts with people who claimed to have ties to top Russian officials, in the first criminal charges alleging links between the campaign and Moscow, according to court documents released on Monday. According to the court documents, Papadopoulos, a Chicago-based international energy lawyer, told the March 31, 2016, meeting that he had connections that could help arrange a Trump-Putin meeting. Asked at a news briefing if the Republican president recalled the suggestion by Papadopoulos, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said: â€œNo I donâ€™t believe he does.â€ The charges against Papadopoulos were made public just after indictments charging Trumpâ€™s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and another aide with multiple offenses, including money laundering, conspiracy against the United States and failing to register as foreign agents. The New York Times said Trump, in a telephone conversation with the newspaper on Wednesday, said investigations into possible collusion between his campaign and Russia had not come anywhere near him personally. â€œIâ€™m not under investigation, as you know,â€ the Times quoted Trump as saying. Pointing to Manafortâ€™s indictment, the president said:  â€œThereâ€™s not even a mention of Trump in there,â€ according to the Times. â€œIt has nothing to do with us.â€ U.S. intelligence agencies said in January that Russia had meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to discredit Trumpâ€™s Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. Trump has denounced the investigations as a witch hunt. Russia denies meddling in the U.S. election. Manafort and Rick Gates on Monday pleaded not guilty to the charges, some of which go back more than a decade and center on Manafortâ€™s work for Ukraine. Neither Trump nor his campaign was mentioned in the indictment against Manafort and Gates.  ",politicsNews,"November 1, 2017 ",Real
"Ex-British spy paid $168,000 for Trump dossier, U.S. firm discloses","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Washington research firm paid a former British spyâ€™s company $168,000 for work on a dossier outlining Russian financial and personal links to Donald Trumpâ€™s 2016 election campaign, the U.S. firm said in a statement on Wednesday. Although it was public knowledge that Fusion GPS paid for the work, the amount had not been disclosed. Fusion GPS hired former MI6 officer Christopher Steele to collect information about Trump and his advisers. Fusion GPSâ€™ statement said it had told Congress about how  $168,000 was paid last year to Orbis Business Intelligence, Steeleâ€™s company. The money paid to Orbis was taken from $1.02 million it received in fees and expenses from the Perkins Coie law firm, the statement said. The law firm represented the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clintonâ€™s presidential campaign, although initial research by Fusion into Trump and other Republican primary candidates was commissioned by a conservative website. Steeleâ€™s reports are central to investigations by a special counsel and congressional committees into U.S. intelligence agency allegations that Russia tried to help Trumpâ€™s campaign. Russia had repeatedly denied the allegations. Trump denies any collusion with Moscow officials, calling the probes a witch hunt. In an Oct. 29 message posted on Twitter, President Trump said the dossier had cost as much as $12 million, without providing evidence. â€œNever seen such Republican ANGER & UNITY as I have concerning the lack of investigation on Clinton made Fake Dossier (now $12,000,000?),....â€ Trump tweeted.     Sources familiar with Steeleâ€™s work said he began working for Fusion GPS in May 2016 and stopped with the election. Earlier, a Washington-based conservative website backed by a wealthy Republican donor, the Washington Free Beacon, hired Fusion to conduct research on Trump and other Republican candidates.

Senate panel to vote next week on online sex-trafficking bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Commerce Committee will vote next week on a bipartisan proposal that would make it easier to penalize operators of websites that facilitate online sex trafficking, the panel said in a statement on Wednesday. U.S. technology companies including Alphabetâ€™s Google and Facebook have long opposed legislation that would amend what is known as Section 230 of the decades-old Communications Decency Act, arguing it could thwart digital innovation and prompt endless litigation. The vote is a setback for the internet industry, which is witnessing shifting political fortunes in Washington on a range of policy issues after decades of relatively little regulatory scrutiny. Silicon Valley companies generally consider Section 230 a bedrock legal protection because it helps shield companies from liability for the activities of their users. The legislation from Republican Senator Rob Portman and Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal in August came after years of law-enforcement lobbying for a crackdown on the online classified site backpage.com, which is used for sex advertising. The measure would make it easier for states and sex-trafficking victims to sue social media networks, advertisers and others that fail to keep exploitative material off their platforms. In a statement, Portman said the lawmakers should â€œact with urgency to hold online sex traffickers accountable and give survivors the justice they deserve.â€ The bill has attracted bipartisan support from about a third of the Senate. A companion measure has similar backing in the House of Representatives. Republicans control both chambers.  Technology lobbyists in recent weeks have engaged in negotiations with lawmakers supportive of the bill in an attempt to narrow its impact. ",politicsNews,"November 1, 2017 ",Real

But rather than focus on the politics of running as a transgender woman, she prefers to discuss traffic gridlock and other issues in the Nov. 7 election for the Virginia House of Delegates. â€œTransgender people are just as qualified to say, â€˜Hey, I canâ€™t stand being stuck in traffic right now. I have some ideas to fix this,â€™â€ said Roem, a 33-year-old journalist. â€œWe can be leaders on transportation. We can be leaders on economic development, and yeah, we can be leaders on civil rights too.â€ Her candidacy comes as more transgender men and women are vying for voices in the political arena where they have been targeted by conservative lawmakers seeking to limit their rights, most notably by restricting bathroom access.      U.S. elections this year could double the countryâ€™s number of transgender officeholders, currently at six, according to the Victory Fund, which works to elect lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender candidates. The group has endorsed eight transgender candidates up for election this fall. A transgender man and woman are running for city council in Minneapolis. A mayoral race in Midvale, Utah, and school board contest in Erie, Pennsylvania, are among the other contests with transgender candidates. Nearly 30 races in the 2017-18 election cycle already have a transgender candidate, up from 13 in 2015-16, according to Logan Casey, a research associate at Harvard University tracking them. The communityâ€™s electoral push comes as Republican President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration has reversed guidance to public schools on allowing transgender studentsâ€™ bathroom choice and wants to ban transgender people from military service. Other minority groups also have battled discrimination through gains at the polls. But transgender candidates face unique challenges in making their case to voters who often have never met another transgender person, at least not knowingly.     â€œItâ€™s sort of a double-pronged task that a lot of these candidates have,â€ Casey said. â€œThey have to run for office and persuade people to vote for them and also educate them about what it means to be a transgender person.â€ Phillipe Cunningham, a 30-year-old black transgender man running for city council in Minneapolis, once thought he would have no chance at professional success because people would be put off by his gender identity. Now he marvels at the support he is receiving on the campaign trail.  â€œPeople see me and they are like, â€˜Youâ€™re cool and you know what you are talking about, and you really love this community,â€™â€ he said. In Galesburg, Illinois, a city of 30,000, 23-year-old Chris King lost an aldermanâ€™s race earlier this year in which she emphasized business development. The card she handed to voters also highlighted the diversity she would bring as a transgender woman of color. She braced for the topic to become an issue at public forums, but it never came up.  â€œI am not 100 percent sure if that is good or bad,â€ said King, a part-time student and pet stylist, who knows it was discussed privately. â€œIt would open the door for some conversations to happen that need to happen to educate people.â€ In Virginia, Roem seeks to unseat a 25-year Republican incumbent of the House of Delegates who filed a bill to limit bathroom access for transgender people on the same day Roem launched her candidacy. Delegate Bob Marshall and the state Republican Party use male pronouns to refer to Roem. The party recently sent mailers to voters in her district that took issue with her support for school policies supporting transgender youth, suggesting she wanted to push an agenda on students as young as kindergarten. â€œThe mailers absolutely do not attack Danicaâ€™s gender identity,â€ John Findlay, executive director of the Republican Party of Virginia, said in a statement.  Marshall did not reply to requests for comment. Roem said Republicans are resorting to bullying after years of failing to address votersâ€™ quality-of-life concerns.  â€œThis is all they have left: transphobic B.S.,â€ she said in an email on Monday. Roem dreams of the milestone moment that would follow an historic win with her introduction in the legislature as â€œthe gentlewoman from Manassas.â€ She would smile at two transgender youth she imagines would be watching from the chamber gallery. â€œThat fundamentally changes the conversation,â€ she said. â€œAnd then, letâ€™s get onto business. Then I pursue governing.â€ ",politicsNews,"October 31, 2017 ",Real
Next U.S. disaster aid approval likely in December: Senator Cornyn,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The next round of aid to help rebuild Puerto Rico and U.S. states after destructive hurricanes and wildfires is unlikely to be considered by Congress until it takes up a catch-all spending bill that faces a Dec. 8 deadline for passage, the No. 2 Senate Republican said on Wednesday. John Cornyn said a crush of other matters would take up time, so â€œwe probably wonâ€™t get to thatâ€ (disaster aid) until consideration of a massive bill to fund federal agencies through next Sept. 30. The Trump administration has said it will submit to Congress a third round of disaster aid in mid-November that could total tens of billions of dollars. Congress already has provided over $51 billion Currently, the Republican-controlled Congress is mainly focused on passing a major tax reform bill by yearâ€™s end. The disaster aid would help recovery efforts in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands following Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria in August and September. Six weeks after Maria tore through Puerto Rico, the island is struggling to pick up the pieces, and about two-thirds of its residents remain without power. The U.S. territory declared bankruptcy earlier this year and the storm has plunged its economy into deeper uncertainty. The government-wide spending bill could also become a magnet for measures that Democrats, who are in the minority in Congress, want to attach. Those could include a bipartisan plan to temporarily bolster the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as â€œObamacare.â€ Democrats also are hinting that the end-of-year measure could be an opportunity to force passage of legislation protecting from deportation young â€œDreamers,â€ people brought illegally to the United States as children.

"Senate Banking chair, Democrats say still hopeful for deal on Dodd-Frank bank rules rewrite","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senior U.S. Republican and Democratic Senators said on Wednesday they would push ahead with efforts to reach a bi-partisan deal on rolling-back some financial rules introduced the 2008 financial crisis, even after a leading Democratic lawmaker walked away from talks. Their comments bolstered hopes among banking lobbyists that Congress may yet agree legislation to roll-back some aspects of the 2010 Dodd Frank law, potentially cutting billions in costs for banks, after bi-partisan discussions appeared to falter. Senator Sherrod Brown, the leading Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, said in a statement on Wednesday that he was stepping away from months-long private negotiations with the Committeeâ€™s Republican chair Senator Mike Crapo over rolling-back elements of the 2010 Dodd Frank law, saying they had reached an impasse. On Wednesday, however, Crapo told reporters he was still working towards a regulatory reform bill and would renew efforts to reach a bipartisan compromise.  â€œI intend to move forward to build a bipartisan solution, and I hope to be able to do so soon,â€ Crapo told reporters. Bank lobbyists told Reuters they remained optimistic a bill still could be passed, saying Brownâ€™s exit had cleared the path for several Democrats more sympathetic to Crapoâ€™s position to take over the negotiations. Spokespeople for Senators Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly, two of the banking panelâ€™s moderate Democratic members, told Reuters on Wednesday they were open to rekindling the talks. â€œCongress needs to make the financial regulatory system work better for everyone, and Iâ€™m willing to work with anyone on a deal that would accomplish that goal,â€ Heitkamp said in a statement. Donnelly said in a statement he believed there was still an opportunity to negotiate a relief package for community financial institutions â€œwhile protecting consumers and ensuring the safety of our financial system.â€ The House of Representatives has already passed a broad rewrite of Dodd-Frank legislation, but the Senate will ultimately determine what, if any, relief the Republican-led Congress hands to banks. Industry expectations on a final deal had been modest because Senate Republicans need eight Democrats to support their efforts in order to pass changes to Dodd Frank.  The exact shape of a regulatory reform bill is not public. There is bipartisan support for easing requirements on smaller banks and credit unions, but reducing the number of banks that face stricter oversight because they are considered critical to the financial system has proved a point of contention. Currently, banks with over $50 billion in assets are considered â€œsystemically important â€œ and must comply with stricter rules. Republican lawmakers are considering raising that threshold, but this is opposed by some powerful Democrats including Senator Elizabeth Warren. â€œAfter working in good faith, itâ€™s clear we will not be able to reach a compromise that protects consumers while supporting small banks and credit unions,â€ said Brown in a statement. â€œI continue to support small banks and credit unions, but I cannot agree to gutting protections for working people and taxpayers.â€ (This version of the story was refiled to add missing word â€œfollowingâ€ in the lead paragraph) ",politicsNews,"November 1, 2017 ",Real
Trump panel urges more treatment options to fight opioid crisis,"(Reuters) - A panel convened by U.S. President Donald Trump to tackle the opioid crisis called on Wednesday for more treatment programs, tighter prescribing guidelines and additional drug courts to help reduce overdose deaths. The commission, led by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, said the recommendations would require funding by Congress but did not recommend an amount. Trump last week declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency. Public health experts broadly welcomed the proposed measures. â€œThis sounds to me like a very progressive and very needed move,â€ said Professor Kosali Simon, a health economist at Indiana University, of the recommendations.     But Paul Hanly, a New York lawyer representing local governments in a legal battle against opioid makers, said recommendations, while laudable, would be â€œtoothlessâ€ without substantial funding. Opioids include prescription painkillers, heroin and fentanyl. More than 100 Americans die daily from overdoses, according to federal data. The commission recommended a national media campaign to encourage opioid addicts to seek help. Only 10.6 percent of people who need treatment get it, the report noted. The media campaign would encourage addicts to â€œstop being afraid or ashamed of seeking help when facing their addiction.â€ It urged expansion of drug courts, in which addicts convicted of non-violent offenses are diverted into programs that combine treatment with mandatory drug testing and court appearances. The commission said drug courts, which are currently offered in just 44 percent of U.S. counties, should embrace medication-assisted treatment to improve outcomes. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration last week announced plans to encourage wider use of substitute opioids such as methadone and buprenorphine, which do not induce a high and are used to help people through drug addiction recovery. Still, Dr. Stefan Kertesz of the University of Alabama at Birmingham said communities often lack treatment facilities where drug courts can send addicts. And many drug courts charge fees that make them unaffordable for many. â€œDrug courts often function as pay to play,â€ Kertesz said. â€œOnly people who can come up with money can escape a prison sentence.â€ The report recommended expanding the ranks of emergency responders allowed to administer naloxone to treat overdoses. It also encouraged stricter prescribing guidelines for physicians. ",politicsNews,"November 1, 2017 ",Real
Republicans defend Trump court pick rated 'not qualified',"(Reuters) - Senate Republicans mounted a concerted defense of one of President Donald Trumpâ€™s nominees to a federal appeals court on Wednesday, suggesting a nonpartisan lawyersâ€™ group rating of Leonard Steven Grasz as â€œnot qualifiedâ€ for the bench was biased. During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Graszâ€™s nomination, the Republicans universally praised the Nebraska lawyer, whom Trump wants to fill a vacancy on the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis.  Negative assessments by the American Bar Association, which has been evaluating federal court picks for decades, are rare. It last gave an appeals court nominee a rating of â€œnot qualifiedâ€ in 2006. That nominee was withdrawn.  The ABAâ€™s 15-member standing committee on the federal judiciary voted unanimously on the poor rating for Grasz, with one member abstaining. The report focused largely on Graszâ€™s advocacy on conservative social issues, including his opposition to abortion rights. â€œMany questioned whether Mr. Grasz would be able to detach himself from his deeply held social agenda,â€ Pamela Bresnahan, chair of the groupâ€™s judicial nominee vetting committee, said in a statement. On Wednesday, Republican senators questioned the credibility of the process. â€œThey do a terrific job ordinarily, but sometimes theyâ€™re just ridiculous, and in your case I think theyâ€™re not only ridiculous, theyâ€™ve been political,â€ Republican Senator Orrin Hatch said, adding he would support Graszâ€™s appointment.  The dustup over Grasz comes as the full Senate continues to confirm Trumpâ€™s judicial choices amid Republican complaints that Democrats are obstructing the process. Ten have been confirmed so far, including Joan Larsen, who was approved on Wednesday to sit on the federal appeals bench in Cincinnati.  The ABA, the largest lawyers group in the United States, says its judicial evaluations are non-partisan, taking into account experience, knowledge of the law and other factors, but not political or ideological views.  As Nebraskaâ€™s former chief deputy attorney general, Grasz defended the stateâ€™s â€œpartial-birthâ€ abortion ban, among other laws.  Grasz told the senators he would be bound to follow the Supreme Courtâ€™s abortion precedents. He said that during the second interview by the ABA, â€œI was asked repeatedly for my personal opinions on social issues including abortion.â€ Nebraska Senator Deb Fischer, a Republican, called the ABA rating a â€œbaseless political character assassination.â€ She claimed the two main evaluators both had ties with Democrats.  Bresnahan declined comment on Wednesday. She will testify before the Judiciary Committee on Nov. 15. ",politicsNews,"November 1, 2017 ",Real
Exclusive: Congressional committee questions operation of WHO cancer agency,"LONDON, (Reuters) - Two influential U.S. Congressmen have asked the World Health Organizationâ€™s cancer agency to get ready to testify about its work assessing if substances cause cancer, citing concerns about its â€œscientific integrityâ€. Their letter to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), seen by Reuters and sent on Wednesday, is part of ongoing investigations by two Congressional committees into IARC that were fueled by the agencyâ€™s review of glyphosate, the primary ingredient of Monsanto Coâ€™s weedkiller Roundup. A letter to IARC director Chris Wild from the Republican chairmen of the House Committee on Science and the Subcommittee on Environment said they are â€œconcerned about the scientific integrityâ€ of IARCâ€™s â€œmonographâ€ program, which assesses whether various substances can cause cancer in people. IARC, a semi-autonomous part of the WHO based in Lyon, France, has in recent years assessed whether substances as diverse as coffee, mobile phones and processed meat cause cancer - reports that have all caused controversy. A spokeswoman for IARC said she could not immediately comment on whether the letter had been received. IARC says its methods are scientifically sound and its monographs are â€œwidely respected for their scientific rigor, standardized and transparent process and ... freedom from conflicts of interestâ€.    In a second letter seen by Reuters, the Congressmen, Lamar Smith and Andy Biggs, expressed concern that IARCâ€™s assessment meetings, deliberations and drafts are not made public.  â€œIt is an affront to scientific integrity to keep â€˜confidentialâ€™ a scientific process that directly influences policy and individual taxpayers,â€ Smith and Biggs wrote.   â€œWith United Statesâ€™ taxpayer dollars funding (part of the monograph program), it is this (Science) Committeeâ€™s duty to ensure sound science and transparency within the agency.â€ Citing data from the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), the letter to Wild said that since 1985, IARC has received more than $48 million from NIH, more than $22 million of which went to the monographs program. It added that Smithâ€™s Committee on Science, Space and Technology may soon hold a hearing to receive testimony from IARC on how it conducts its reviews. It asked Wild to provide â€œnames and contact information of IARC-affiliated individuals who would serve as potential witnesses for this hearingâ€. The second letter, sent on Wednesday to acting U.S. Health Secretary Eric Hargan, asked his department to provide â€œall documents and communications between or among members of the IARC monograph program and any research institutes or agencies within HHS.â€ In this letter, the lawmakers said their aim was to understand the extent to which the taxpayer-funded National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and the National Institutes of Health are involved with IARCâ€™s monograph process. This is â€œto ensure scientific integrity and an honest use of taxpayer dollarsâ€, the letter said.  In an assessment in 2015 that put it at odds with many government regulators, including those in the United States, Europe and Japan, IARC classified glyphosate as â€œprobably carcinogenicâ€.          A Reuters investigation in October found that a draft of a key section of IARCâ€™s assessment of glyphosate underwent significant changes before the report was made public. Reuters also reported in June on how the chairman of the IARC glyphosate panel was aware of new data showing no link between the weed-killer and cancer in humans, but the agency did not take it into account because it had not been published. The Congressional committee letters cited these Reuters investigations as well as other media reports, saying they revealed â€œtroubling evidenceâ€ about the way IARC operates. In the letters, Smith and Biggs asked IARC to respond by Nov. 8, and the department of Health and Human Services to respond by Nov. 15. ",politicsNews,"November 1, 2017 ",Real
Congress should weigh U.S. regulation of gun 'bump stocks': Republican Senator,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Congress should consider legislation that would regulate â€œbump stocks,â€ the attachments that allowed the Las Vegas gunman to fire his semi-automatic rifles more rapidly, U.S. Senator John Cornyn said on Wednesday. Cornyn, the second-ranking Senate Republican, told reporters that if the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) does not have the authority to regulate bump stocks,  â€œmaybe thatâ€™s something we ought to consider giving them.â€ Cornyn, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he was urging panel Chairman Charles Grassley to call a hearing on bump stocks. â€œIâ€™d like to hear from the ATF who previously during the Obama administration said they didnâ€™t feel like they had the authority to regulate those. Iâ€™m not sure I agree with that,â€ the Texas senator said. On Oct. 1, a gunman in Las Vegas opened fire at an outdoor music festival killing 58 people and injuring nearly 500 others before killing himself, the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.  The attachments are legal and allow semiautomatic rifles to operate as if they were fully automatic machine guns, which are heavily restricted in the United States. Slide Fire Solutions, the maker of bump stocks, has announced that it is restarting sales of the product after a pause following the Las Vegas shooting. ",politicsNews,"November 1, 2017 ",Real
North Korean defector pushes diplomatic solution in U.S. Congress,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A rare high-level defector from North Korea told U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday that disseminating more information in the reclusive country would ultimately be more effective than the billions of dollars being spent to address the military threat. â€œWe can educate (the) North Korean population to stand up by disseminating outside information,â€ Thae Yong-ho, chief of mission at Pyongyangâ€™s embassy in Britain until he defected in 2016, said during an appearance at Congress two days before President Donald Trumpâ€™s first trip to Asia since taking office. Asked what kind of information he was discussing, Thae said background about North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, like his birth date, to convey the idea that he and his family â€˜are not gods.â€ He said South Korean videos, for example were increasingly available within the North.  â€œThe U.S. is spending billions of dollars to cope with the military threat and yet how much does the U.S. spend each year on information activities involving North Korea in a year? Unfortunately, it may be a tiny fraction,â€ he said. Thae made his first visit to Washington during rising international tensions over North Koreaâ€™s nuclear and ballistic missiles program. The crisis is expected to dominate Trumpâ€™s trip to the region, which includes a stop in South Korea. Thae also told the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee that U.S. officials should meet with Kim at least once to try to understand his thinking and convince him that he is risking mass destruction. Thae said Kim thinks he can force the United States to accept North Korea as a nuclear power and drive U.S. forces off the Korean peninsula. Reuters reported on Tuesday that Washington was quietly pursuing direct diplomacy with North Korea, despite Trumpâ€™s public assertion that such talks are a waste of time. Amid a war of words between Kim, who has called Trump a â€œmentally deranged dotard,â€ and Trump, who referred to Kim as â€œlittle rocket man,â€ many U.S. lawmakers have been pushing for non-military solutions to the crisis. Representative Ed Royce, the committeeâ€™s Republican chairman, called at the hearing for a â€œdramatic increaseâ€ in the number of individuals and entities targeted for sanctions, without delay. Thae is the highest-level defector from North Korea in two decades. In emotional testimony, he described a life before he left for South Korea that mixed relative privilege and oppression. He said he defected because he could not let his sons lead â€œa life, like me, as a modern-day slave.â€ ",politicsNews,"November 1, 2017 ",Real

Obamacare 2018 enrollment clouded by uncertainty under Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As Americans began signing up for Obamacare health insurance plans on Wednesday, experts expected reduced participation as a bitter political debate clouds the programâ€™s future.      Republicans in Congress have repeatedly failed to repeal and replace former President Barack Obamaâ€™s healthcare law, which they have said drives up costs for consumers and interferes with personal medical decisions. Democrats have warned that repeal would leave millions of Americans without health coverage.  President Donald Trump promised to kill Obamaâ€™s Affordable Care Act in his 2016 election campaign, and has taken steps to undermine a law he has declared â€œdeadâ€ and â€œimplodingâ€. Trumpâ€™s administration cut Obamacare advertising by 90 percent and shortened the enrollment period by half.  â€œThe marketâ€™s going to be extremely confusing. Thereâ€™s going to be entire complexity of choice,â€ said David Anderson, a health policy researcher at Duke University.  Obama took to social media on Wednesday, encouraging Americans who need insurance to sign up on the federal Healthcare.gov website. He stressed that government tax credits would keep coverage affordable for most.  Obama asked people to get out the word, â€œbecause this country works best when we look out for one another.â€ A new Trump ad, paid for by the Republican National Committee, blamed Democrats for Obamacareâ€™s â€œskyrocketingâ€ insurance premiums and for blocking efforts to repeal the law.      Obamacare advocates have warned that sign-ups for individual insurance coverage under the law could drop by about one million people in 2018 compared with 2017. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that four million fewer people will sign up for Obamacare private insurance than previously forecast due to Trump policies.  Still, CBO expects total enrollment to reach 11 million in 2018, up from the around 10 million who obtained and paid for coverage in 2017. Administration officials could not immediately say when 2018 enrollment data would be made public.  The Trump administration has cut the 2018 enrollment period in half to six weeks from Nov. 1 to Dec. 15 for states using the federal Healthcare.gov website. Enrollment previously ran until Jan. 31, and many consumers tended to sign up in the last two weeks, according to state officials and organizations that help people choose insurance. The administration has also cut off billions of dollars in subsidies that insurers use to discount out-of-pocket medical costs for low-income Americans and cut funding to groups that help people enroll in health insurance.  Several insurers have exited Obamacare markets due to concerns over subsidies and other Trump actions. Those that remained raised monthly premium prices to account for the lost government subsidies. Senate Republicans and Democrats are working on legislation to stabilize Obamacare markets in the short term, including restoring the subsidies. But Trump has sought more far-reaching changes, and urged Republicans to take up full-scale repeal again in the coming months.      The Department of Health and Human Services said on Monday that premiums for the most popular Obamacare plans would rise 37 percent in 2018. Americans eligible for Obamacare tax credits to buy insurance may pay less for coverage, but middle-class consumers who do not get subsidies will face much higher prices for these plans. â€œItâ€™s been such a flood of information. A lot of the population thinks the Affordable Care Act has already been put under,â€ said Daniel Polsky, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and executive director of the Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics. â€œThe strange premium increases are going to be very confusing for consumers.â€ The Trump administration is now planning changes for 2019. Last week, it proposed a rule giving states more flexibility over the benefits that must be covered by insurance. Under Obamacare, all insurers have to cover a set of 10 benefits, such as maternity and newborn care and prescription drugs.  ",politicsNews,"November 1, 2017 ",Real
"Court document shows Manafort wealth, ties to Russian oligarchs","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Paul Manafort, former campaign manager for President Donald Trump, had three U.S. passports, millions in assets and ties to Russian oligarchs, according to federal court documents after his indictment on tax fraud and money laundering charges. Manafort and associate Rick Gates pose a significant flight risk because of the serious nature of the charges, the strong evidence of guilt, their wealth and â€œtheir history of deceptive and misleading conduct,â€ federal prosecutors said in a filing Tuesday in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Manafort, 68, and Gates, who also worked on Trumpâ€™s campaign, pleaded not guilty on Monday in a 12-count indictment, ranging from money laundering to acting as unregistered agents of Ukraineâ€™s former pro-Russian government. The charges came as part of federal special counsel Robert Muellerâ€™s 5-month-old investigation into alleged Russian efforts to tilt the 2016 presidential election in Trumpâ€™s favor and potential collusion by campaign aides. The allegations are not related to campaign activities but reveal close ties to Russia, and include activities from 2006 to 2017, which overlaps with the mensâ€™ work on Trumpâ€™s campaign. The two men are under house arrest and have relinquished their U.S. passports, with a $10 million bond set for Manafort and a $5 million bond for Gates. â€œBoth defendants have substantial ties abroad, including in Ukraine, where both have spent time and have served as agents of its government,â€ according to the governmentâ€™s memorandum in support of the conditions of release.  â€œAnd both Manafort and Gates have connections to Ukrainian and Russian oligarchs, who have provided millions of dollars to Manafort and Gates.â€  The next hearing in the case, set for 2 p.m. (1800 GMT) on Thursday, will concern the bail conditions that were set at Mondayâ€™s arraignment. Manafort was a longtime U.S. Republican operative before turning his attention to political consulting overseas. He submitted 10 passport application in the last decade and currently holds three U.S. passports, the memo said. It is rare but legal to hold three valid passports. People can apply for more than one passport under limited circumstances, including when a foreign country will deny entry to someone holding a passport showing travel to certain other countries or when a visa request is being processed but a  person needs a valid passport for immediate travel, a State Department official said on Wednesday. The official could not comment on Manafortâ€™s passport records but said requests for more than one valid passport are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Asked about the information in the memo, Manafort lawyer Jason Maloni told Reuters on Wednesday his client â€œlooks forward to having these allegations tried before a judge and jury.â€ The memo said Manafortâ€™s financial assets were substantial but difficult to quantify because he listed figures on loan applications and other financial documents since 2012 that ranged from $19 million to $136 million. Manafort and Gates owned or controlled entities and accounts worldwide including in Cyprus, Grenadines, Seychelles and England, it said.

Release of House tax bill delayed until Thursday,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives will delay the release of long-awaited tax legislation by one day until Thursday, the head of the chamberâ€™s tax-writing panel said late on Tuesday. â€œIn consultation with President Trump and our leadership team, we have decided to release the bill text on Thursday,â€ House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady said in a statement. â€œWe are pleased with the progress we are making and we remain on schedule to take action and approve a bill at our Committee beginning next week,â€ the Republican lawmaker added. In a tweet on Tuesday night before Bradyâ€™s statement, President Donald Trump said: â€œThe Republican House members are working hard (and late) toward the Massive Tax Cuts that they know you deserve. These will be biggest ever!â€ Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress, are looking to tax reform for their first legislative victory since Trump took office in January. Democrats say the Trump tax plan is a giveaway to corporations and the rich. Two sources with knowledge of the discussions said earlier on Tuesday that the bill, which had been expected on Wednesday, would emerge a day later to give lawmakers additional time to address differences over the tax treatment of retirement savings accounts and a deduction for state and local tax payments. Trump and other top Republicans have proposed a plan that would cut taxes for corporations, small businesses and individuals by up to $6 trillion over a decade and pay for the reductions in part by eliminating trillions of dollars in deductions and other tax breaks that are often fiercely defended. The U.S. tax code has not undergone a major overhaul since 1986, when Republican Ronald Reagan was president.  Earlier on Tuesday, House Republicans appeared to be nearing a deal on state and local taxes that would preserve a federal deduction for property taxes but not income taxes, potentially removing a major obstacle. Republican Representative Tom Reed of New York said the â€œsweet spotâ€ compromise was gaining support among high-tax state lawmakers who have signaled their opposition to a proposal to repeal the state and local tax, or SALT, deduction. Another New York Republican saw things differently. â€œIâ€™m still inclined to be opposed to it. The income tax is a major factor,â€ said Representative Peter King. â€œThis is going to affect our country for the next 20 years, for good or bad. I think the last time we did tax reform, there was like two years of debate. Weâ€™re going to have 10 days,â€ he said. The SALT compromise would reduce, but not eliminate, a disproportional tax impact on upper middle-class families in high-income tax states such as New York, New Jersey and California. Those states send enough Republicans to Congress to derail a tax bill. The House bill is expected to cut the top corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and phase out the estate tax paid by the wealthiest taxpayers over two or three years. It may also set a repatriation rate for U.S. businesses with profits overseas, according to a source familiar with a Tuesday meeting between House Speaker Paul Ryan and conservative groups. It is also likely to set a 15 percent minimum tax on active foreign income of U.S. corporations, according to lobbyists with knowledge of negotiations. As the Trump administration escalated its pro-tax plan campaign, Vice President Mike Pence met with Republicans on Tuesday, while Trump hosted industry leaders and then Ryan, at the White House. Trump said at the White House he wanted Congress to pass tax reform bills by the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on Nov. 23. A proposal to limit how much money Americans can direct to their 401(k) retirement accounts and individual retirement accounts (IRAs) on a pre-tax basis is meeting resistance, including from fund managers who handle 54 million such accounts. Republicans initially proposed capping tax-free 401(k) contributions at $2,400, down from $18,000 in 2017, but the figure is in flux. â€œWe are either going to strengthen the 401(k)â€™s and IRAâ€™s so people can save more, or we will leave them as is,â€ Brady told reporters. Senator Heidi Heitkamp, one of a few Democrats being courted by Republicans, said she could not support lowering the cap on tax-free retirement contributions. â€œI will not vote for that,â€ she told reporters.

U.S. senators hammer Facebook for power over elections,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. senators on Tuesday pressed Facebook Incâ€™s chief lawyer on why the company did not catch 2016 election ads bought using Russian rubles, why its investigation of them took so long and how much it knows about its 5 million advertisers. Democrats and Republicans at the Senate crime subcommittee hearing fired questions for much of two hours at Facebook General Counsel Colin Stretch, who said that in retrospect the company should have done more.  â€œIn hindsight, we should have had a broader lens. There are signals we missed,â€ Stretch said under questioning from Democratic Senator Al Franken about how the company missed political ads bought with Russian money. Stretch called the Russia-based ads â€œreprehensibleâ€ for their political divisiveness. The hearing marked the first time tech executives have appeared publicly before U.S. lawmakers on the Russia matter, and the tone represented a dramatic shift in fortunes for Silicon Valley, which for years has grown accustomed to favorable regulatory treatment in the United States.  Lawyers for Twitter Inc and Alphabet Incâ€™s Google also faced questions at the hearing about how Russians used their services, but Facebook drew the bulk of senatorsâ€™ ire because of its unique role in targeted marketing on the internet.  Facebook has broader reach than the smaller Twitter network, and it offers more powerful targeting capabilities than Google.  â€œI suspect that your advertising department has watched the profits go up,â€ Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy told Stretch, who responded that Facebook was committed to rooting out accounts that use fake names.  Lawyers for the three companies were scheduled to return to Capitol Hill on Wednesday for two more hearings on Russia ad spending.  The Russian government has denied it intended to influence  the 2016 presidential election, in which Republican Donald Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.   Facebook, in a series of disclosures over two months, has said that people in Russia bought at least 3,000 U.S. political ads and published another 80,000 Facebook posts that were seen by as many as 126 million Americans over two years.  Senators said they could not understand the timing of Facebookâ€™s disclosures.  â€œWhy has it taken Facebook 11 months to come forward and help us understand the scope of this problem?â€ Democratic Senator Chris Coons asked.  Stretch responded that, when U.S. spy agencies alleged in January that Russians meddled in last yearâ€™s election, â€œwe werenâ€™t sitting around.â€ The company over the following months launched an investigation and reported the results, he said.  Facebook has also announced steps to change how it treats political ads. It said it is hiring 1,000 more people to review ads, compiling a publicly searchable archive of political ads beginning next year and requiring more information about the identity of election advertisers. Coons said he wished the tech companies had sent their top executives on Tuesday rather than in-house lawyers.  Republican Senator John Kennedy told Stretch that he doubted Facebookâ€™s ability to stop people overseas from buying U.S. election ads. U.S. law bars election spending by non-Americans. â€œYouâ€™ve got 5 million advertisers and youâ€™re going to tell me that youâ€™re able to trace the origin of all those advertisements?â€ Kennedy asked Stretch.  The Facebook lawyer responded that there was little the company could do if a foreign advertiser used a U.S. shell corporation.  Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, chairman of the crime subcommittee, said he wanted to help the tech companies, but he also pressed Stretch on whether Iran and North Korea could try to do what Russia did in the United States.  Stretch responded: â€œCertainly potentially. The internet is borderless.â€   Hanging over Facebook, Google and Twitter is the threat of legislation that would extend rules governing political advertising on television, radio and satellite to also cover social media.  The companies have responded with proposals for self-regulation, saying they would create their own public archives of election-related ads.  Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar told witnesses on Tuesday that self-regulation would lead to a â€œpatchworkâ€ of databases and that a uniform system would be better for voters.

"Return Manafort's money, Democrats demand of California Republican","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - A California neuroscientist vying to unseat Republican Congressman Dana Rohrabacher stepped up his criticism of the conservative on Tuesday, demanding he return a $1,000 contribution from indicted Trump adviser Paul Manafort. The Orange County seat held by Rohrabacher is key to Democratsâ€™ hopes to increase their numbers in the U.S. House of Representatives in next yearâ€™s elections. Neuroscientist Hans Keirstead, a stem cell researcher and entrepreneur from Laguna Beach, is one of seven Democrats aiming to beat him, according to the Federal Election Commission. â€œWeâ€™ve got a Russian-tainted Congressman taking Russian-tainted money from Manafort,â€ Keirstead said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. â€œSomething has to be put straight here.â€ Federal investigators probing Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election on Monday charged Manafort, a lobbyist and former Trump campaign manager, with money laundering. Rohrabacher, a senior member of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, has frequently praised Russian President Vladimir Putin and was considered for a role in U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s cabinet. His Southern California base in Orange County was for decades a Republican stronghold and a center of support for Ronald Reagan. Reliably conservative voters there have sent Rohrabacher to the House for nearly 30 years. But the 48th Congressional district has undergone profound demographic shifts in recent years, and it is now one of nine Republican districts in California that Democrats have targeted. Hillary Clinton beat Trump in the district in 2016, winning 152,000 votes compared to his 146,600. â€œThese are people who care about the environment, care about social issues,â€ said Drew Godinich, a spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in California. â€œDonald Trump and Donald Trumpâ€™s Republican Party are no longer a good match for them.â€ Democratsâ€™ success in the district, however, is far from assured. Despite a tilt toward Clinton for the presidency, voters there chose Rohrabacher over Democrat Suzanne Savary by more than six percentage points in 2016. Through a spokesman, Rohrabacher indicated that he was not at this time prepared to reject Manafort - or the $1,000 donation the political operative made to his 2014 campaign. â€œThe Congressman advises his political opponents and the media to observe the presumption of innocence, still an American principle,â€ spokesman Ken Grubbs said in an email.

"Manafort spent millions on homes, rugs, clothes: court filing","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Paul Manafort, the indicted former campaign manager for President Donald Trump, spent almost $1 million on eight rugs in two years and more than $1.3 million on clothes from shops in Beverly Hills, California, and New York City. His lavish lifestyle - with homes in Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Hamptons, Arlington, Virginia and elsewhere - were detailed in an indictment filed with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that was revealed on Monday. The indictment filed by Justice Department Special Counsel Robert Mueller said Manafort â€œused his hidden overseas wealth to enjoy a lavish lifestyle in the United States.â€ Prosecutors said they found payments by Manafort for four Range Rovers and a Mercedes-Benz among transactions that they alleged came illegally from overseas to avoid paying U.S. income taxes, according to the 31-page court filing. Prosecutors said they found evidence he bought a condo in a restored red-brick building in New Yorkâ€™s upscale Soho neighborhood for $2.85 million, also from overseas money, most often from Cyprus.  Manafort and associate Rick Gates pleaded not guilty on Monday to money laundering and other charges filed in a probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.  Manafort and Gates both appeared stoic throughout a court hearing on Monday. Greg Andres, a federal prosecutor on Muellerâ€™s team, said his office had a â€œdifficult timeâ€ trying to pin down Manafortâ€™s and Gatesâ€™ net worths, making it hard to set appropriate bail arrangements. Andres said Manafort listed a wide range of net asset values on loans and other financial documents, from as low as $20 million to as high as $100 million. Gates, meanwhile, listed assets as low as $2 million and as high as $30 million. A federal judge ordered house arrest for both men, and set a $10 million unsecured bond for Manafort and a $5 million unsecured bond for Gates. Manafortâ€™s attorney Kevin Downing said on Monday there was no evidence that his client colluded with the Russian government while working for the Trump campaign. Neither Trump nor his campaign was mentioned in the indictment. Manafort ran the Trump campaign from June to August of 2016 before resigning amid reports he might have received millions of dollars in illegal payments from a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine. The indictment said both Manafort and Gates generated tens of millions of dollars of income from Ukraine work and laundered money through scores of U.S. and foreign entities to hide payments from American authorities. The indictment said he spent $849,215 in a menâ€™s clothing store in New York and $520,440 at one in Beverly Hills. He spent $5,434,793 on a house in Water Mill, New York, in Long Islandâ€™s Hamptons, shelling out $820,240 for landscaping. Aerial photos of the place show gardens, a pool, a tennis court, a basketball court and a putting green and sand trap on 2.37 acres (0.96 hectare). A seven-bedroom Brooklyn brownstone, which he bought for $3 million, was described in a real estate agentâ€™s listing as â€œdripping with detail - perfectly intact crown moldings and medallions, gold leafed carved window detail, 5 marble mantels, and original Lincrusta paper wall covering.â€ ",politicsNews,"October 30, 2017 ",Real
Russian lawyer who met Trump Jr. seeks return to U.S. to defend money laundering settlement,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who met with Donald Trump Jr. during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, wants permission to return to the United States to defend a claim by prosecutors that her clientâ€™s company has failed to pay a $6 million settlement in an international money laundering case. Veselnitskaya represented Prevezon Holdings Ltd, a Russian-controlled company, which in May this year agreed to pay nearly $6 million to the U.S. government to settle a $230 million  Russian tax fraud case related to Hermitage Capital, an American fund that invested in Russia.     In a court filing in federal court in Manhattan on Monday U.S. prosecutors said the settlement payment was due on Oct. 31, but in a letter on Tuesday filed in federal court in Manhattan  lawyers for Prevezon disagreed. About half of the settlement money was supposed to come from 3 million euros owed to Prevezon that the U.S. government had asked the Netherlands to freeze.  The Netherlands lifted the hold on the money on October 10, but the same day imposed a new freeze on the account based on a complaint by William Browder, chief executive of Hermitage Capital Management, the Prevezon letter said. In Mondayâ€™s court filing, U.S. prosecutors said the $6 million payment was due regardless of the new freeze on the funds and they intended to file a motion to enforce the settlement.  In its letter, Prevezon asked the court to help obtain temporary U.S. immigration status for Veselnitskaya and its owner, Denis Katsyv, so she could attend upcoming hearings about the dispute.  Veselnitskaya met Donald Trump Jr in New York last year while she was in the United States to represent Prevezon in the money laundering case.  Trump Jr. said in a statement at the time that he and Veselnitskaya â€œprimarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian childrenâ€ after Russia in 2012 banned adoptions of Russian children by Americans in retaliation for sanctions imposed under the U.S. Magnitsky Act.  The Magnitsky Act was passed by Congress after Hermitage Capitalâ€™s Browder claimed that the tax fraud scheme involving Prevezon was uncovered by Sergei Magnitsky, an auditor for Hermitage Capital, who died in a Russian prison. Trump Jr. has released emails related to the meeting during last yearâ€™s election that described Veselnitskaya as a Russian government attorney who could provide information that would â€œincriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.â€ ",politicsNews,"November 1, 2017 ",Real
Former Trump campaign adviser denies encouraging aide on Russia dealings,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A former senior adviser on President Donald Trumpâ€™s campaign team, Sam Clovis, sought to distance himself on Tuesday from George Papadopoulos, an ex-campaign aide who has pleaded guilty in the probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty earlier this month to lying to Federal Bureau of Investigation agents about his dealings with Russians, including an April 2016 meeting in which he was told the Russians had â€œdirtâ€ on Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton that entailed â€œthousands of emails.â€ Prosecutors on Special Counsel Robert Muellerâ€™s team said in court records that Papadopoulos had conversations and email exchanges with an unnamed â€œcampaign supervisorâ€ about efforts to improve U.S.-Russia relations by setting up meetings between senior campaign and Russian officials. According to those records, the campaign supervisor conveyed to Papadopoulos in a March 6, 2016, discussion that â€œa principal foreign policy focus of the campaign was an improved U.S. relationship with Russia.â€ A source familiar with the investigation said Clovis was the campaign supervisor referenced in the court records. Victoria Toensing, a lawyer for Clovis, did not dispute that but added that her client never said improving U.S.-Russia relations was a â€œprincipal foreign policy focusâ€ because that was not his view of Trumpâ€™s priorities. Mueller is leading a probe into alleged Russian efforts to tilt the election in Trumpâ€™s favor and into potential collusion by Trump aides. Russia denies the allegations and Trump denies any collusion. Prosecutors said in the court records that Papadopoulos emailed the supervisor and several others to tell them he had met with a professor who had in turn introduced him to a Russian woman and the Russian ambassador in London, and that they discussed setting up meetings to talk about U.S.-Russia ties in a Trump presidency. The supervisor replied that he would â€œwork it through the campaignâ€ and not to make a commitment at that point. â€œGreat work,â€ the supervisor added in the email. In August 2016, the supervisor wrote to Papadopoulos in reference to a possible â€œoff the recordâ€ meeting with Russian officials, saying: â€œI would encourage youâ€ and another foreign policy adviser â€œto make the trip.â€ In her response, Toensing said: â€œDr. Clovis always vigorously opposed any Russian trip for Donald Trump or staff. However, if a volunteer made suggestions on any foreign policy matter, Dr. Clovis, a polite gentleman from Iowa, would have expressed courtesy and appreciation.â€ Clovis has since been nominated by Trump to a top post as chief scientist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Debbie Stabenow, the ranking member of the Senate panel that will vet the nomination, told Reuters she was concerned. â€œThe emerging information about his role in the Trump campaignâ€™s interactions with Russia raises serious concerns,â€ she said in a statement. NBC News reported on Tuesday that Clovis had been questioned by Muellerâ€™s team and testified before the grand jury. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Tuesday that Trumpâ€™s campaign team provided the special counsel with emails involving Papadopoulos, and described it as a case of an individual doing the â€œwrong thingâ€ while the campaign did the â€œright thing.â€   ",politicsNews,"October 31, 2017 ",Real
"In Russia probe, Mueller's first charges a show of force","WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trump brushed off the first indictments in the probe of his campaignâ€™s ties to Russian election meddling, but the charges sent a clear signal to the White House and other Trump associates: Robert Mueller means business. By going after Trumpâ€™s campaign manager and another aide on money-laundering charges and securing a guilty plea from a third campaign adviser, the special prosecutor showed he would delve deeply into the past in search of criminal activity and use his broad powers aggressively. That left some Trump associates worried about what or whom Mueller would target next, despite the White Houseâ€™s public dismissal of the developments as unrelated to the president and his campaign. â€œTheyâ€™re flexing their muscles for anybody that they approach in this investigation and letting them know we really mean it,â€ said former federal prosecutor Patrick Cotter. â€œSo if we come to you, you should talk to us. Manafort didnâ€™t and look what happened to him.â€ Manafort and Rick Gates are charged with money laundering, tax fraud, conspiracy to defraud the United States, and other counts. They pleaded not guilty on Monday. The indictments, which closely detail the alleged crimes, appeared to be an opening salvo from Mueller. He was appointed by U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in May after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, who had led an investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election. Mueller was given a mandate to probe potential collusion and â€œany matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.â€ Trump has denied any collusion with Russia and at times described the investigation as a â€œhoaxâ€ and a â€œwitch hunt.â€     Russia has denied interfering with the 2016 election. With the first indictments on Monday, Mueller showed he was not afraid to use his powers, and Trump officials noticed. â€œOne thing Iâ€™m worried about in a bigger scale is that Rosenstein, by giving Mueller this wide berth, has created this monster,â€ said one former White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  A former Trump campaign adviser fretted that the probe could, as a result, touch on Trumpâ€™s businesses, too.  In a New York Times interview in July, Trump indicated that Mueller would be crossing a red line if he investigated Trumpâ€™s family business. Â Â Â  Legal experts said Mueller would not be swayed by Trumpâ€™s view of the proper scope of the investigation. â€œI donâ€™t think prosecutors concern themselves with what politicians say about red lines being drawn,â€ said former federal prosecutor Robert Capers. Jens David Ohlin, a professor of criminal law at Cornell Law School, said Mueller could be targeting alleged financial crimes by Manafort and Gates to gain their cooperation and uncover wrongdoing elsewhere. A number of lawyers said the guilty plea of George Papadopoulos, announced by Muellerâ€™s team on Monday, could ultimately provide a closer link to the campaign and pressure others to open up. While the charges against Manafort and Gates were not related to their campaign work, Papadopoulos admitted he lied to the Federal Bureau of Investigation about his contacts with foreign nationals he believed to be tied to the Russian government while he was a campaign adviser. Prosecutors said they arrested Papadopoulos in July and that he was cooperating with the government.  â€œGod knows what this guyâ€™s going to say now,â€ said the former Trump campaign adviser. â€œSince heâ€™s cooperating, he could set any perjury traps up for others.â€ Cotter said Muellerâ€™s unveiling of Papadopoulosâ€™ guilty plea â€œwas to head off any arguments that the case against Manafort and Gates is not about Russia.â€  Frank Montoya, a former senior FBI agent, said Manafortâ€™s indictment and Papadopoulosâ€™ plea indicated Mueller was not going to bow to White House pressure and would keep pushing hard to uncover wrongdoing. â€œIt is pretty much a road map â€“ we are going to be looking at the money laundering, we are going to be looking at the failure to report income, we are going to be looking at the general criminal conspiracies. This is also about Trumpâ€™s red line â€“ we are going to cross it. And we are going to keep looking at the so-called collusion, or the coordination with the Russians to undermine democracy,â€ Montoya said. ",politicsNews,"October 31, 2017 ",Real

"Vocal, powerful critic of Wall Street rules leaving Congress","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Representative Jeb Hensarling, the Republican chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, announced on Tuesday that he would retire from Congress at the end of 2018, marking the exit of Congressâ€™s leading advocate for rolling back strict financial rules. Hensarling, 60, of Texas, said in a statement that he would not seek re-election, noting that his term as head of the banking panel expires at the same time. He has been a vocal proponent of significant deregulation in the financial sector and an author of sweeping legislation to drastically reduce the regulations imposed on banks. â€œToday I am announcing that I will not seek re-election to the U.S. Congress in 2018,â€ Hensarling said in a statement.Â â€œAlthough service in Congress remains the greatest privilege of my life, I never intended to make it a lifetime commitment, and I have already stayed far longer than I had originally planned.â€ Hensarling, first elected to Congress in 2002, had been the architect of a broad rewrite of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law. The overall would have eliminated several of the major powers given to regulators after the 2007-2009 financial crisis and impose strict new limitations on their authority. That bill, the Financial CHOICE Act, is not expected to become law after passing the House, due to insufficient support in the Senate. But his work was hailed by GOP colleagues as an ambitious effort to cut regulation of the banking industry. â€œJeb has eloquently articulated this conservative vision, leading the charge to repeal Dodd-Frank and deliver a freer market that gives every American the opportunity to achieve the American dream,â€ said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy in a statement. Banking lobby groups, including the Financial Services Roundtable and American Bankers Association, said Hensarling had been a strong leader who advanced reforms that led to economic opportunity and better banking. He has been a steadfast critic of rules imposed on the financial sector after the crash, and became an industry ally in efforts to roll them back. But those efforts also made him a top target of advocates of stricter rules, who said his efforts would put Americans at risk of a similar meltdown. â€œHensarling has probably just decided to spend more time with his banks. We hope the revolving door doesnâ€™t hit him too hard on the way out,â€ said Karl Frisch, executive director of Allied Progress. While some GOP lawmakers have announced plans to retire after facing uphill re-election battles, Hensarling hails from a deeply conservative district in Texas where he remains highly popular. In 2016, he faced no Republican rivals in the partyâ€™s primary and took 80.6 percent of the districtâ€™s vote in the general election. Even though the district consistently votes Republican, his resignation will provide another opportunity for Democrats to realize their hopes of taking control of the House in 2018. Lawyer Dan Wood, has already entered the race to be the partyâ€™s nominee for the seat. Unlike some exiting Republicans, Hensarling never publicly feuded with President Donald Trump. In fact, Trump had considered Hensarling for a post in his administration after the election. His exit will set off a competition to take over as head of the powerful banking committee. Representative Patrick McHenry is the vice chair of the committee, but Representatives Blaine Luetkemeyer, Bill Huizenga, and Sean Duffy are also potential contenders, according to lobbyists familiar with the committee. One lobbyist said Luetkemeyer was the leading candidate to lead the panel, as McHenry is seen as a rising star in House leadership. Luetkemeyer is â€œseriously consideringâ€ running for the chairmanship, according to his spokeswoman. Hensarlingâ€™s next move is unclear. Some lobbyists speculated he could take a top role at a conservative think tank like the Heritage Foundation. Alternatively, he could take a role in the administration or return to his home state. Cowen and Co analyst Jaret Seiberg said in a client note that Hensarling could be â€œthe top contenderâ€ to take over the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which regulates Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The current FHFA Director, Mel Watt, is an appointee of former President Barack Obama, serving out a term that expires in January of 2019. ",politicsNews,"October 31, 2017 ",Real
U.S. nuclear arsenal to cost $1.2 trillion over next 30 years: CBO,"(Reuters) - Modernizing and maintaining the U.S. nuclear arsenal over the next 30 years will cost more than $1.2 trillion, according to a report released on Tuesday by the Congressional Budget Office. The report said current plans for the modernization of the aging planes, ships and missile silos that make up the U.S. nuclear arsenal would cost 50 percent more than if the U.S. only operated and maintained its current equipment in the field. The CBO study reviewed the Obamaâ€™s Administrationâ€™s plans for modernization of the nuclear arsenal. President Donald Trump in January directed Secretary of Defense James Mattis to conduct his own review the U.S. nuclear forces. The results could be published in the coming months.  U.S. House Armed Services Committee member Adam Smith, a Democrat from Washington, said of the Obama-era plan: â€œCongress still doesnâ€™t seem to have any answers as to how we will pay for this effort, or what the trade-offs with other national security efforts will be.â€  The report said costs would rise from $29Â billion in 2017 to $47Â billion in 2027, before peaking at around $50Â billion a year through the early 2030s. Trump has said he wants to ensure the U.S. nuclear arsenal is at the â€œtop of the pack,â€ saying the United States has fallen behind in its weapons capacity. U.S. officials have noted that Americaâ€™s nuclear modernization is lagging behind Russiaâ€™s upgrade of its own nuclear triad. General Paul Selva, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Congress in August he believed Moscow was already two-thirds of the way through its nuclear modernization process. In August, the U.S. Air Force awarded Boeing Co and Northrop Grumman Corp separate contracts to continue development work on the replacement of the aging Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile system one leg of the nuclear triad.  Days later the Air Force awarded Lockheed Martin Corp and Raytheon Co separate $900 million contracts to continue work on a replacement for the AGM-86B air-launched nuclear cruise missile. That detailed development contract allows the companies to continue work on the long range standoff weapon yet another leg of the triad. ",politicsNews,"October 31, 2017 ",Real
U.S. Senate Republicans want to speed Trump nominee approvals,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Leading Republicans in the U.S. Senate, expressing frustration at how slowly President Donald Trumpâ€™s nominees are being confirmed, on Tuesday called for changes in the chamberâ€™s procedures to speed up the approval process. â€œI believe it is time to change the rules of the Senate,â€ Senate Republican Policy Committee Chair John Barrasso told reporters, saying a way needed to be found to shorten debate times. Trump has complained bitterly about Senate rules slowing progress on his agenda. But the president has generally focused his criticism on a Senate rule that requires 60 votes for most legislation to advance in the 100-member chamber - the so-called filibuster rule. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said that Republicans do not want to change the 60-vote requirement for legislation. But McConnell, speaking to reporters after Barrasso on Tuesday, said there may be a way to reduce the time spent on debating judicial and other nominees after they clear an initial hurdle. Currently that time is capped at 30 hours. Republicans have repeatedly complained that Democrats are using the time allowance to drag out confirmation of Trumpâ€™s nominees. â€œDue to the Democratsâ€™ obstruction, this administration has had the lowest percentage of nominees confirmed of any administration in the past 30 years,â€ Barrasso said in a news release. At this point in Democratic then-President Bill Clintonâ€™s term, Clinton had 76 percent of his nominees confirmed, and Democratic then-President Barack Obama had 67 percent, while Trump has had fewer than 40 percent, Barrasso said. Barrasso suggested the Senate might want to revive a bipartisan agreement from a previous Congress. It allowed debate on Supreme Court nominees and Cabinet members to last up to 30 hours, but other categories of nominees got less: either eight or two hours. Two other senior Republicans, Senators John Cornyn and Roy Blunt, suggested Republicans could change the rules unilaterally if Democrats are not interested in negotiating a change. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer sidestepped a question on the matter. â€œSenator McConnell does not come to the floor with clean hands on these issues. He delayed and blocked so many of Obamaâ€™s nominees, in fact many of the judges theyâ€™re now filling should have been filled by Obama nominees,â€ Schumer told reporters. Earlier this year, McConnell moved to scrap the 60-vote hurdle on Supreme Court nominations to clear the way for confirming Neil Gorsuch to the court. Previously, when Democrats ran the Senate, they ended the 60-vote hurdle on other executive branch nominations. ",politicsNews,"October 31, 2017 ",Real
Trump chief of staff's Civil War comment sparks criticism,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - White House Chief of Staff John Kellyâ€™s comment that the U.S. Civil War was sparked by a lack of â€œcompromiseâ€ drew criticism and reignited a debate over Confederate monuments and the role of slavery. In an interview on Monday night with Fox News, Kelly was asked whether a Virginia church should have removed plaques honoring Confederate General Robert E. Lee and President George Washington, both Virginians. Kelly said figures of the past could not be viewed through the lens of current moral values. â€œI think itâ€™s just very, very dangerous and it shows you ... how much of a lack of appreciation of history and what history is,â€ Kelly said. â€œI will tell you that Robert E. Lee was an honorable man.â€ â€œThe lack of an ability to compromise led to the Civil War, and men and women of good faith on both sides made their stand where their conscience had them make their stand,â€ Kelly added. The comment sparked an immediate backlash, with critics noting that the United States had made a number of compromises on slavery before tensions eventually erupted into the war between the North and the South in 1861. â€œNotion that Civil War resulted from a lack of compromise is belied by all the compromises made on enslavement from Americaâ€™s founding,â€ Ta-Nehisi Coates, an African-American writer, wrote on Twitter. Others accused Kelly of encouraging white supremacists by saying Lee was honorable. â€œItâ€™s irresponsible & dangerous, especially when white supremacists feel emboldened, to make fighting to maintain slavery sound courageous,â€ Bernice King, the daughter of American civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr., wrote in a Twitter post. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders, asked on Tuesday about Kellyâ€™s comment, told a news briefing: â€œGeneral Kelly was simply making the point that just because history isnâ€™t perfect, it doesnâ€™t mean that itâ€™s not our history.â€ Replying to another question about whether figures such as  Nathan Bedford Forrest, a Confederate general accused of war crimes and an early leader of the Ku Klux Klan, deserved to be honored, Sanders said: â€œThe president has said that those are something that should be left up to state and local governments, and thatâ€™s not who Iâ€™m here representing today.â€  President Donald Trump has said Confederate monuments, many of which have been removed in recent years, should remain in place to preserve the countryâ€™s heritage.  He stirred tensions after a deadly rally by white nationalists in Charlottesville, Virginia, by insisting that counterprotesters were also to blame, drawing condemnation from some Republican leaders and praise from white supremacists. Kelly had a distinguished military career and led the Department of Homeland Security before Trump tapped him to be chief of staff.  Kelly is viewed by some as a moderating influence in the turbulent White House, but has also stepped into controversy. Earlier this month, he attacked a Florida congresswoman who had characterized a call between Trump and a military widow who lost her husband in Niger as disrespectful.

Senior Republican proposes more oversight of foreign lobbying,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley, head of the Senate Judiciary Committee, proposed a bill on Tuesday to overhaul disclosure rules regarding anyone working on behalf of a foreign government, a law that has received renewed attention after Paul Manafort was indicted for violating it.  The proposed legislation, called the Disclosing Foreign Influence Act, would close loopholes in the Foreign Agents Registration Act and require the Department of Justice to develop a strategy for enforcing the law, the Republican senator said in a statement.  Manafort, a longtime Republican operative who briefly served as Donald Trumpâ€™s campaign manager in 2016, and his business associate Rick Gates, pleaded not guilty on Monday to a 12-count indictment that contained charges ranging from money laundering to acting as unregistered agents of Ukraineâ€™s former pro-Russian government. The current law, known as FARA, requires persons acting on behalf of a foreign government or political party to disclose to the Department of Justice their work as well as public communications taken on behalf of that client.  Critics have argued the reporting requirements for FARA are unclear and contains loopholes that allow American lobbyists to avoid disclosure of their foreign clients. â€œCongress passed the Foreign Agents Registration Act to prevent inappropriate influence in domestic policy, but my oversight work has uncovered rampant disregard by foreign agents and lackluster enforcement by federal authorities,â€ Grassley said in a statement.   The proposed law would clarify who is required to register, improve investigative tools, including granting authority for the Justice Department to pursue civil charges, and create new reporting requirements. FARA was first passed in 1938 in the lead up to World War II in an effort to combat German propaganda efforts and was later amended in 1966 to include lobbyists, according to the Department of Justice. As the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Grassley is empowered to see that the bill quickly receives a hearing and a vote. ",politicsNews,"October 31, 2017 ",Real
White House: Trump campaign gave Papadopoulos emails to special counsel,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House said on Tuesday the Trump campaign provided the special counsel investigating ties between it and Russia with emails involving George Papadopoulos, a campaign adviser who has pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents about contacts with people who claimed to have ties to top Russian officials. â€œI think that Papadopoulos is an example of actually someone doing the wrong thing while the presidentâ€™s campaign did the right thing,â€ White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said.  â€œAll of his emails were voluntarily provided to the special counsel by the campaign and that is what led to the process and the place that weâ€™re in right now with the campaign fully cooperating and helping with that,â€ she told a news briefing.

U.S. EPA bans some scientists from independent advisory boards,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced on Tuesday it will bar certain scientists from serving on its independent advisory boards, a move critics say could open the way to more industry-friendly advisors on the panels. The EPA barred scientists who have won agency-awarded grants in the past, billing the step as a way to preserve the independence and diversity of the boards, which provide the scientific input for agency decisions around pollution and climate change regulation. â€œWhatever science comes out of EPA, (it) shouldnâ€™t be political science,â€ EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, said in a release, adding that committee members will be â€œfinancially independentâ€ from the agency.  Senator Tom Carper, the top Democrat on the Senate environment committee, said Pruittâ€™s decision was part of an EPA effort to â€œdelegitimize the work of nonpartisan scientists.â€ Carper added, â€œthis crusade endangers the health of every American, and it cannot be tolerated.â€ Pruitt signaled the move during a speech last week at the conservative Heritage Foundation, when he questioned the independence of scientists who have won past EPA research grants, and promised to â€œfixâ€ the situation. During his election campaign last year, Republican President Donald Trump promised to roll back environmental regulations from Democratic President Barack Obamaâ€™s administration, including those limiting carbon dioxide emissions blamed for global warming, to make government more friendly to the drilling, mining, and manufacturing businesses.     The advisory boards were created by Congress to serve as a check on EPA policies and research. They include the EPA Scientific Advisory Board, the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, and the Board of Scientific Counselors.  Last year, the SAB questioned an EPA report that concluded that hydraulic fracturing - an oil and gas drilling technology that frees petroleum from underground shale formations - had no ""widespread impacts"" on drinking water despite evidence of problems in several states. (reut.rs/2h2GTrD) In June, Pruitt decided not to renew the terms of nine members of a separate body, the 18-member Board of Scientific Counselors. One of those members, Michigan State University professor of community sustainability Robert Richardson, told Reuters the move came as a surprise because the work they were doing was â€œapolitical.â€     The EPA is also expected to announce three new members of the Clean Air advisory committee on Tuesday. Pruitt is an outspoken doubter of mainstream climate science, a consensus of scientists that carbon dioxide from human use of fossil fuels is a primary driver of global warming, triggering more frequent volatile storms, sea level rise, and droughts.  Pruitt has said he wants to set up a televised debate about the science of climate change between scientists who believe it is driven by humans and those that do not.

Democrats want a law to stop Trump from bombing North Korea,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic U.S. senators introduced a bill on Tuesday they said would prevent President Donald Trump from launching a nuclear first strike on North Korea on his own, highlighting the issue days before the Republicanâ€™s first presidential trip to Asia. The measure would stop Trump, or any U.S. president, from launching an attack on North Korea, or spending any money on a military strike, without congressional approval, unless North Korea has first attacked the United States. Tensions between Washington and Pyongyang have been building after a series of nuclear and missile tests by North Korea and bellicose verbal exchanges between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The CIA has said North Korea could be only months away from developing the ability to hit the United States with a nuclear weapon, a scenario Trump has vowed to prevent. â€œI worry that the presidentâ€™s enthusiasm will not be checked by the advisers around him,â€ Democratic Senator Chris Murphy, the legislationâ€™s lead sponsor, told reporters on a conference call. Some Republicans have also expressed concern about Trumpâ€™s rhetoric, but none co-sponsored the bill, which is backed by seven Democrats and Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent. Republicans control majorities in both the Senate and House, and there has been no indication that congressional leaders would allow a vote. Similar measures introduced earlier this year have also failed to advance. However, backers said they might try to pass it later this year by introducing it as an amendment to legislation such as a  as a must-pass spending bill. â€œI have confidence that if this came to a vote on the floor of the Senate, it would prevail,â€ Murphy said. Lawmakers have been trying to take back more control over foreign policy from the White House. Congress passed a bill in July barring the president from lifting sanctions on Russia without lawmakersâ€™ approval, and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Monday held a hearing on a new authorization for the use of military force, or AUMF, to exert some authority over the campaign against Islamic State and other militant groups. At that hearing, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis said Trump does not have the authority to use force against North Korea without an imminent threat, but they did not define what such a threat would be.

Kremlin says Russia not accused in U.S. case against ex-Trump aides,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Tuesday that U.S. charges against President Donald Trumpâ€™s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and another aide showed Moscow had been unfairly maligned in accusations that it meddled in last yearâ€™s U.S. presidential election. Federal investigators probing alleged Russian interference in the election, something Moscow denies, charged Manafort and Rick Gates with money laundering on Monday. But despite being brought as part of a five-month-old investigation into alleged Russian efforts to tilt the election in Trumpâ€™s favor and into potential collusion by Trump aides, the charges, some going back over a decade, centered on Manafortâ€™s work for Ukraineâ€™s former government, not Russiaâ€™s. That was welcomed in Russia, where officials are watching the investigation closely since public evidence of Russian meddling, something that has not so far been presented, would be sure to translate into tougher U.S. sanctions against Moscow. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov highlighted the absence of allegations against Russia in the indictment against Manafort and Gates, saying on Tuesday that Moscow had always said it had never interfered in the U.S. election. That assertion is challenged by U.S. intelligence agencies  who say unequivocally that Moscow did interfere in the November 2016 vote. â€œ...Russia does not feature in the charges that were leveled in any way. Other countries and other people feature (in the charges),â€ Peskov told a conference call with reporters. â€œMoscow never felt itself guilty so it doesnâ€™t feel  exonerated now,â€ he said, when asked whether the Kremlin interpreted the indictment as proof that its repeated denials about meddling election were true. Peskov also brushed aside any suggestion that someone with links to the Russian Foreign Ministry might have tried to set up a meeting with the Trump campaign through a third ex-aide, George Papadopoulos, who it was announced on Monday pleaded guilty in early October to lying to the FBI.  Russiaâ€™s flagship TV news show took a similar line on Monday evening, saying it was â€œnow clear that there was nothingâ€ to allegations about Manafort being in touch with Russian officials to try to sway the election.     The U.S. investigation was an internal matter for the United States, said Peskov, but Moscow was following it with interest. Peskov laughed off the purported role of Papadopoulos, who told investigators he had tried to set up a meeting between the Trump campaign and the Russian leadership. In his unsuccessful quest to broker such a meeting, Papadopoulos said he had met a London-based professor boasting of contacts with Russian officials and an unnamed Russian woman. He also mentioned being in touch with someone linked to the Russian Foreign Ministry. Peskov, when asked what the Kremlin made of someone linked to the Foreign Ministry allegedly trying to set up a Putin-Trump meeting, said: â€œItâ€™s an absolutely laughable allegation.â€ Media reports have suggested the individual linked to the ministry is Ivan Timofeev, who works for a Moscow-based think-tank called the Russian International Relations Council (RIAC).  Timofeev did not respond to a request for comment, but told the gazeta.ru online news portal in August that Papadopoulos had emailed him in the spring of 2016 and spoken about the possibility of organizing a Trump trip to Russia. Timofeev said Papadopoulos had never made a formal request to either RIAC or the Russian Foreign Ministry for such a visit, however, and that he had got the impression that he had been â€œacting on his own initiativeâ€ and was â€œan enthusiast with little experience.â€ Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters on Tuesday that there was nothing â€œillegalâ€ about Papadopoulos contacting someone at RIAC.

U.S. lobbying trade group urges Congress to revamp disclosure laws,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An industry group for lobbyists on Tuesday called on Congress to overhaul the transparency laws that govern their activity in the wake of indictments of two lobbyists, including Paul Manafort, a former campaign manager for U.S. President Donald Trump. Charges filed by Justice Department Special Counsel Robert Mueller alleged Manafort and business partner Rick Gates failed to properly disclose lobbying for a foreign government. After the indictment was made public, Washington lobbyist Tony Podesta, a longtime powerbroker, stepped down from the firm bearing his name as the company came under scrutiny in the investigation for work it did with Manafort. â€œToday is another unnecessary black eye for the lobbying profession,â€ said Paul Miller, a lobbyist who heads the National Institute for Lobbying and Ethics (NILE). â€œThe indictments of Paul Manafort and Rick Gates should send a message to the lobbying profession that this type of activity cannot be tolerated and to Congress that its time to take a hard look at the (Lobbying Disclosure Act).â€  Manafort, a longtime Republican operative, and Gates pleaded not guilty on Monday to a 12-count indictment that contained  charges ranging from money laundering to acting as unregistered agents of Ukraineâ€™s former pro-Russian government. NILE has previously encouraged Congress to close loopholes in the Lobbying Disclosure Act, known as LDA, to make lobbying more transparent by subjecting more activity to disclosure and requiring lobbyists to reveal when an intermediary hires them on behalf of another organization.  Two separate laws require lobbying disclosure: The LDA, which covers domestic interests, and the Foreign Agents Registration Act, under which Manafort was charged and requires disclosure for lobbying on behalf of foreign entities.  â€œToday, we hear the echoes of crickets when we go to the Hill asking for reforms that will have a direct and immediate impact,â€ Miller said.

Senators to introduce bill to boost cyber defenses of voting systems,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan pair of U.S. senators plans to introduce legislation on Tuesday seeking to boost the cyber defenses of state election systems, after warnings from senior U.S. officials that future elections may be vulnerable to foreign interference. The Securing Americaâ€™s Voting Equipment, or SAVE, Act is the latest attempt by lawmakers to respond to what U.S. intelligence agencies say was a multi-pronged cyber operation, including hacking and online propaganda by Russia during the 2016 presidential election aimed at helping President Donald Trump. Moscow has repeatedly denied the accusations. The bill will be introduced by Democratic Senator Martin Heinrich and Republican Senator Susan Collins, a Heinrich spokeswoman said. It does not currently have other co-sponsors. â€œUntil we set up stronger protections of our election systems and take the necessary steps to prevent future foreign influence campaigns, our nationâ€™s democratic institutions will remain vulnerable,â€ Heinrich said in a statement. The SAVE Act would authorize the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to grant security clearance to the top election official in each state in addition to one other designee. It would also allow the DNI to share some classified information with the states about threats to their voting systems. Several state election officials have complained that they were left in the dark about Russiaâ€™s attempts to probe their voting systems during the 2016 campaign. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not notify 21 states it said had been targeted by Russian until last month, in part due to confidentiality and classification restrictions.  The DHS in January designated voting systems as a critical part of the nationâ€™s infrastructure, making state elections eligible for more federal protections. The legislation would write that designation into law, and also create a grant program for states to upgrade their systems to better fend off physical and cyber threats. It was not clear whether the bill would gain momentum in an otherwise gridlocked Congress. ",politicsNews,"October 31, 2017 ",Real

Trump says won't divest from his business while president,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would maintain ownership of his global business empire but hand off control to his two oldest sons while president, an arrangement that watchdogs said would not prevent conflicts of interest in the White House. Trump told a news conference he would resign from all positions overseeing his hotels, golf courses and hundreds of other businesses and move his assets into a trust to help ensure that he will not consciously take actions as president that would benefit him personally. Trump, a Republican, is under pressure to distance himself from his businesses before he moves into the White House on Jan. 20. Unlike other U.S. government officials, the president is not required by law to steer clear of conflicts of interest. â€œI could actually run my business and run government at the same time. I donâ€™t like the way that looks, but I would be able to do that if I wanted to,â€ Trump said. Ethics experts said the arrangement did not go far enough. â€œMr. Trumpâ€™s ill-advised course will precipitate scandal and corruption,â€ said Norman Eisen, a former White House ethics adviser under Democratic President Barack Obama. Walter Shaub, director of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, said on Wednesday in a speech at a Washington think tank that his office recommends Trump â€œdivest his conflicting assetsâ€ to avoid conflicts. Trump appears to be still involved with his business while preparing to take office, saying he had turned down a $2 billion development deal in Dubai he had been offered over the weekend. The company that made the proposal, DAMAC, confirmed the discussions had taken place. The Trump Organization will not enter into any new overseas deals while Trump is president and will only undertake domestic projects after a company ethics adviser has approved them, said Trump adviser Sheri Dillon. Details of how the ethics adviser would operate, as well as several other aspects of the arrangements, were not immediately clear. Trump will only know of those deals if he hears about them through the news media, said Dillon, a lawyer at Morgan Lewis who focuses on tax and ethics. Trumpâ€™s daughter, Ivanka, will have no further involvement in managing the organization or her own clothing brand. Ivanka Trump said on her Facebook page that she would take time off to settle her family into their new home in Washington. The president-elect has named her husband, Jared Kushner, to a senior advisory role in the White House. Since Trump sold all his stocks last year, the Trump trust will hold only business assets and liquid assets such as cash, Dillon said.  A financial disclosure document he filed in May also showed loans from lenders such as Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) and Ladder Capital (LADR.K). Trump will not have to file a new disclosure form until 2018. Many other ethics experts, including the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, have urged Trump to completely divest or set up a blind trust for his assets. In a blind trust, the owner does now know what the holdings are or how the assets are managed. Trumpâ€™s oldest sons, Eric and Donald Jr., will be running his business, so the arrangement does not meet that standard. Dillon said that was not a realistic possibility for a family-owned company and any sudden divestment would hurt Trump financially. Unlike liquid assets like stocks and investment funds, much of Trumpâ€™s wealth comes from office towers and other real estate that cannot be sold easily, as well as licensing deals that could be difficult to unwind. Stripped of the Trump name, many of these assets would lose much of their value, Dillon said. â€œPresident-elect Trump should not be expected to destroy the company he built,â€ she said. Dillon dismissed concerns that Trump could violate an anti-bribery provision in the U.S. Constitution, known as the Emoluments Clause. That applies to gifts, but not business transactions like renting a hotel room, she said. Nevertheless, profits generated at Trumpâ€™s hotels by foreign governments will be donated to the U.S. Treasury, she said. ",politicsNews,"January 11, 2017 ",Real

Trump's Treasury nominee Mnuchin pledges to divest assets worth millions,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trumpâ€™s nominee for Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, has pledged to divest at least $94 million worth of investments in 43 entities to avoid conflicts of interest, according to an ethics agreement released on Wednesday. Mnuchin said in a 42-page financial disclosure report that these investments include more than $50 million worth of common shares of CIT Group Inc, the financial services group that acquired his OneWest Bank in 2015. However, his CIT shares are likely worth more. They are listed in the â€œOver $50 millionâ€ category, the highest amount required on the asset valuation form for presidential political appointees. The investor group he led sold OneWest in 2015 for $3.4 billion, seven years after they purchased the assets of failed mortgage lender IndyMac Bank for $1.55 billion. Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs executive and Hollywood film financier, added that he resigned his position as a CIT director in December as part of his agreement with the Treasuryâ€™s assistant general counsel. He pledged to divest Goldman Sachs shares worth over $5 million and Goldman Sachs Treasury investments worth over $25 million. The disclosure forms, which allow a range for the value of assets, reveal that Mnuchin is worth at least $118 million to around $392 million, making him he richest Treasury secretary since his former boss, ex-Goldman Sachs CEO Henry Paulson, who served under George W. Bush and was worth over $700 million at the time he took office in 2006. By contrast, President Barack Obamaâ€™s Treasury secretaries, Tim Geithner and Jack Lew, were each worth between about $740,000 and $1.7 million when they took office. Under Mnuchinâ€™s ethics agreement, he will refrain from any decisions involving CIT Group until August 2018, when a final payment of at least $5 million from CIT Group is made as part off a â€œholdbackâ€ agreement related to the OneWest merger.  Among other assets disclosed by Mnuchin are a small airplane he operates for business and personal use, and an interest in a 1978 Willem de Kooning oil painting, â€œUntitled IIIâ€, valued between $5 million and $25 million. Mnuchin also said in his ethics agreement that prior to or upon Senate confirmation he would fully disclose the assets of his fiancÃ©e, Scottish-born actress Louise Linton, as if they were married and pledged to refrain from any matter that affects her finances. The documents are on file with the Office of Government Ethics. (here+Index/30AAAB9D74B0557B852580A5004FF9F9/$FILE/Mnuchin,%20Steven%20T.%20finalEA.pdf) ",politicsNews,"January 11, 2017 ",Real
U.S. Transportation nominee Chao hits no roadblocks in confirmation hearing,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trumpâ€™s choice to run the U.S. Transportation Department, Elaine Chao, defended the president-electâ€™s $1 trillion infrastructure plan as a â€œbold visionâ€ on Wednesday in an overwhelmingly friendly Senate confirmation hearing. While there is criticism of Chao, in particular on environmental issues, there is no significant opposition to her nomination and she is expected to be confirmed.  She served as labor secretary under President George W. Bush from 2001 to 2009 and was the first Asian-American woman to hold a Cabinet position. She was deputy secretary of transportation under President George H. W. Bush. She was introduced by her husband, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The top-ranking Democrat on the committee, Floridaâ€™s Bill Nelson, noted his wifeâ€™s friendship with Chao. Chao will take a leading role in Trumpâ€™s plans to rebuild crumbling U.S. roads and bridges with a $1 trillion fund. He would offer private investors who put money into projects an 82 percent tax credit but critics say it is unclear how they could recoup investments in most projects without sharply increasing costs for users of most roads and bridges. Chao described the plan to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation as a â€œbold visionâ€ and acknowledged the need to work on the issue of paying investors back. â€œFor them (partnerships) to be truly effective, there need to be revenue streams that need to be assured,â€ she added. â€œWe all know that the government doesnâ€™t have the resources to do it all.â€  Chao is nominated to head a department with such wide-ranging responsibilities as oversight of the nationâ€™s airports and highways, fuel-economy rules for autos and probes into auto makers for safety recalls of key parts like airbags.  She declined to take positions on issues like whether the job of air traffic control should be privatized, concerns over the safety of shipments of crude oil by rail, foreign airlines like Norwegian Air Shuttleâ€™s push to move into the U.S. market and regulation of developing technology like autonomous vehicles and drones. Chao faced no questions about her memberships on corporate boards. Chao is on the board of Wells Fargo & Co which has struggled since September after it agreed with regulators to pay $190 million in fines and restitution to settle charges that its employees wrongly created as many as 2 million accounts without customer authorization. Chao is an immigrant from Taiwan who arrived in the United States at age 8. Her father, James S.C. Chao, is founder of the Foremost Group, an international shipping company.

I have great respect for the news and great respect for freedom of the press.â€ He strongly criticized CNN for its reporting of the story, refusing to take a question from a reporter for the network, telling him, â€œIâ€™m not going to give you a question. You are fake news.â€ â€œSome of the media outlets we are dealing with are fake news ... All I can ask for are honest reporters.â€  Asked whether he accepted that Russian President Vladimir Putin tried to help him win the election, Trump said, â€œIf Putin likes Donald Trump, I consider that an asset, not a liability.â€ He denied having any business dealings with or in Russia. â€œI have no loans with Russia at all.â€ â€œAs far as hacking, I think itâ€™s Russia. But we also get hacked by other countries and other people, and I can say that.â€ On Putin and hacking, Trump said, â€œHe shouldnâ€™t be doing it.

I hope we get along, but if we donâ€™t, thatâ€™s possible too.  â€œBut Russia and other countries, and other countries, including China, which has taken total advantage of us economically... and (taken) advantage of us in the South China Sea ... Russia, China, Japan, Mexico, all countries will respect us far more, far more, than they do under past administrations.â€ Asked about nominating a Supreme Court justice, Trump said, â€œSo, as you know, I have a list of 20. Iâ€™ve gone through them ... They were outstanding in every case ... Iâ€™ll be making the decision on who we will put up for justice of the United States Supreme Court, a replacement for the great, great Justice (Antonin) Scalia.

I think itâ€™s one of the reasons I got elected.â€ â€œWe have to get our drug industry coming backâ€ to the United States, he said, adding that companies had been â€œleaving left and right.â€ Trump also called for new bidding procedures for U.S. drug companies, saying, â€œTheyâ€™re getting away with murder (with drug prices) ... Thereâ€™s very little bidding for drugs.  â€œWeâ€™re the largest buyer of drugs in the world and yet we donâ€™t bid properly. Weâ€™re going to start bidding and weâ€™re going to start saving billions of dollars.â€ â€œI said I will be the greatest jobs producer that God ever created, and I mean that.â€ â€œYou want to move your plant, and you think, as an example, youâ€™re going to build that plant in Mexico, and youâ€™re going to make your air conditioners or your cars, or whatever youâ€™re making, and youâ€™re going to sell them through what will be a very, very strong border ... Not going to happen. Youâ€™re going to pay a very large border tax.â€ Trump said he would not wait for negotiations with Mexico to be completed before starting to build a wall along the two countriesâ€™ border. â€œI could wait about a year and a half until we finish our negotiations with Mexico, which will start immediately after we get into office; but I donâ€™t want to wait.â€ â€œWeâ€™re going to be submitting ... a plan.

Trump says he'll make high court pick within two weeks after taking office,"(Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump said on Wednesday his team has met with numerous candidates to fill the longstanding U.S. Supreme Court vacancy and promised a decision on a nominee within about two weeks of taking office on Jan. 20. Trump, during a news conference in New York, indicated the importance he attached to the selection of a replacement for conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last Feb. 13. The Republican-led Senate then refused to consider President Barack Obamaâ€™s nominee to the post, appeals court judge Merrick Garland. â€œIt will be a decision which I very strongly believe in. I think itâ€™s one of the reasons I got elected,â€ said Trump, who previously vowed to pick a jurist similar to Scalia, who was one of the most conservative members of the nine-seat court. Trump said he would make his announcement â€œprobably within two weeks of the 20th ... probably the second week.â€ He did not mention any of the potential picks by name or state exactly how many have had interviews, but said, â€œWeâ€™ve met with numerous candidates. They were outstanding in every case.â€ Trump said he would pick from names suggested to him by conservative legal groups. Trump said he had a list of 20 names. The original list his presidential campaign made public included 21 names. Trump specifically mentioned input from the Federalist Society and Republican former South Carolina Senator Jim DeMint. Scaliaâ€™s death left the top U.S. court ideologically split with four conservatives and four liberals. Scaliaâ€™s replacement could tilt the ideological leaning of the court for years to come, restoring the long-standing conservative majority just at a time when it appeared liberals would get an upper hand on the bench. This could be pivotal in wide range of issues including abortion, the death penalty, religious rights, presidential powers, transgender rights, federal regulations and others. The U.S. Constitution calls on the president to nominate members of the Supreme Court, with confirmation of the selection in the hands of the Senate. The Republican-led Senate, in a move with little precedent in U.S. history, refused to consider Democrat Obamaâ€™s nominee, saying the winner of the Nov. 8 presidential election between Republican Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton should make the pick.

"For Russia, U.S. election meddling claims strip Trump win of luster","MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin says U.S. intelligence agency allegations it ran an influence campaign to help President-elect Donald Trump win the White House are false. But if U.S. spies are right, Moscow may wish it hadnâ€™t bothered to meddle in the first place. The belief, widely held in the West, that the Kremlin helped discredit Democratic rival Hillary Clinton by orchestrating embarrassing media leaks, has relegated U.S.-Russia relations to a post-Cold War low and stoked fears Russia will try to subvert French and German elections this year.  And true or not, the bipartisan view that Russia tried to help Trump, supported by a classified U.S. intelligence report, may make it harder, not easier, for Trump to make common cause with President Vladimir Putin, something both men say they want. In the latest wrinkle, U.S. officials said on Tuesday that Trump has been presented with claims that Russia had compromising information about him. The accusations are uncorroborated and denied by the Kremlin. â€œThere was initial delight in Russia when Trump won and there was more delight after Trump picked Rex Tillerson as secretary of state,â€ said Alexei Makarkin, deputy director at the Moscow-based Center for Political Technologies. â€œThere is significantly less delight now.â€ Former Exxon-Mobil CEO Tillerson, Trumpâ€™s pick for Americaâ€™s top diplomat, is seen as a friend of Russia. His firm has been thwarted from carrying out a huge project in the Russian Arctic by economic sanctions imposed by the outgoing Obama administration to punish Moscow for its actions in Ukraine. Makarkin said Trump and his circle would now be accused of being Kremlin stooges every time they pushed for detente with Russia, with senior Republicans likely to warn that any rapprochement would hand political capital to the Democrats. Putin, who has repeatedly praised Trumpâ€™s political skills, is hoping his incoming U.S. counterpart will ease or annul the sanctions, stay out of Russiaâ€™s domestic affairs, and maybe even team up with the Kremlin in the Middle East. But the furor over hacking and allegations of wider Russian interference have triggered pressure from Democrats and Trumpâ€™s fellow Republicans in Congress for tougher, not weaker, anti-Russian measures. That has amplified Congressional calls for an independent bipartisan investigation into Russian dirty tricks and prompted President Barack Obama to expel 35 suspected Russian spies, denting early Russian optimism about a Trump presidency. When the announcement that Trump had won the Nov. 8 presidential election was made in Russiaâ€™s parliament by Vyacheslav Nikonov, the grandson of Stalinâ€™s foreign minister, lawmakers erupted in applause. In Moscow, Clinton was widely seen as being anti-Russian.   Two months later, the mood has soured. â€œThe new hacking allegations against Russia are clearly timed to coincide with the handover of power in the United States,â€ Alexei Pushkov, a senator who sits on the upper house of parliamentâ€™s defense and security committee, said.  â€œThe aim is to force Trump into enmity with Russia.â€    Victoria Zhuravleva, an expert on U.S.-Russia relations who writes analytical papers for the government, said the current mood in the United States meant Trump would struggle to improve relations with Moscow even if he wanted to. â€œIf we are realistic we have nothing to wait for,â€ said Zhuravleva, who said Congress could stymie Trumpâ€™s Russia policies and would probably present him with proposals to hit Moscow with fresh sanctions rather than roll back existing ones. To be sure, some observers of U.S.-Russian relations say the Kremlin still emerges from the affair with a major win: the new U.S. president favors closer ties with Russia and has named people who share that view to key posts. And Trump can plow ahead with rapprochement even if some in Washington oppose it. â€œThe Constitution privileges the Executive in war and foreign policy,â€ Rhodri Jeffreys-Jones, author of â€˜We Know All About You: The Story of Surveillance in Britain and America,â€™ wrote in e-mailed comments. â€œOnce Trump and Putin begin to play together (if they do), the hacking issue will become a minor historical footnote.â€ But with U.S.-Russia tensions so strained, some in Russia fret Washington will strike back with its own cyber attack.  German Klimenko, Putinâ€™s Internet adviser, has suggested Russia must be ready to disconnect itself or to be involuntarily cut off from the global Internet. â€œAmerica could say it will throw up virtual borders to protect itself from (external) influence,â€ Klimenko told Reuters. â€œI can imagine ... any actions.â€  With so much focus on alleged Russian meddling, attention is now turning to presidential elections in France and Germany this year with some European politicians and intelligence services warning Moscow will try to interfere there too. The Kremlinâ€™s preferences appear clear from state media, where Chancellor Angela Merkel has been denigrated as â€˜an old witch.â€™ French National Front leader Marine Le Pen and center-right Francois Fillon have both been portrayed more positively. Former intelligence agents and cyber experts say neither country has the technical ability to protect itself or fully understand by whom and how it is being hacked, creating a rich opportunity for disinformation and unverifiable claims.   Several intelligence experts said elements of Russiaâ€™s intelligence community wonâ€™t be able to resist trying to replicate their U.S. election operations in European elections â€” even while other parts of the ruling elite see such operations as highly risky. â€œThis publicity (around the U.S. election) made Russia look so powerful that it almost provokes them to try their hand elsewhere,â€ said Andrei Soldatov, co-author of Red Web, which examines how the FSB security service uses the Internet.  Yuri Felshtinsky, a friend of murdered Kremlin critic Alexander Litvinenko and an expert in the Russian intelligence services, said Europe should brace itself.   â€œDuring the U.S. campaign Russia created a very powerful tool to influence elections. This tool, including hacking and the creation of web sites involved in publishing fake news, will now be used everywhere.â€ ",politicsNews,"January 11, 2017 ",Real

Debate over firing U.S. consumer watchdog director intensifies," (The Jan. 10 story corrects Sasseâ€™s state to Nebraska in the seventh paragraph) By Lisa Lambert WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The debate over whether President-elect Donald Trump should fire the head of a U.S. consumer watchdog after taking office came to a boil on Tuesday, with congressional lawmakers sending off strong letters that dug into constitutional law.  Republican senators pushing Trump to fire the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Richard Cordray, portrayed the agency as overreaching its authority. Meanwhile, Democrats said firing Cordray would advance a â€œWall Street agendaâ€ to escape federal oversight. The bureau, created in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law, was originally proposed by Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, to guard individuals against lending fraud. At the heart of the debate is a restriction that the president can only fire the director for cause. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is reviewing a recent court decision that the president should be able to fire the director at will. Some want Trump to remove Cordray for cause soon after his inauguration on Jan. 20, and not wait for the appeals courtâ€™s decision. That could open the door for Cordray to sue. Senator Ben Sasse, a Republican from Nebraska, started Tuesdayâ€™s fight with the tweet: â€œItâ€™s time to fire King Richard.â€ Sasse, a member of the Banking Committee, and fellow Republican Mike Lee, of Utah, then released a letter to Vice President-elect Mike Pence saying the CFPB â€œcombines the powers of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches into the hands of a few unaccountable Washington elites.â€ Senator Sherrod Brown, the most senior Democrat on the Banking Committee, shot back with a statement that Cordray should stay until his term expires in 2018. â€œUnder Richard Cordrayâ€™s leadership, the CFPB has returned $12 billion to servicemembers, seniors, and working Americans whoâ€™ve been ripped off by shady debt collectors, for-profit schools, payday lenders, and huge banks like Wells Fargo,â€ Brown said. The CFPB recently was part of a $190 million settlement with  Wells Fargo, which was accused of creating phony accounts.   In the House, 21 Democrats sent a letter to Trump saying no U.S. president has ever removed an independent agency head for cause. â€œWhile we understand that many powerful special interests would like to see DirectorÂ CordrayÂ leave, we urge you not to bow to their demands to initiate costly, meritless litigation, and we stand ready to oppose any efforts you may make to do so,â€ they wrote.

Trump given unverified reports that Russia had damaging details about him,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Classified documents that the heads of four U.S. intelligence agencies presented last week to President-elect Donald Trump included claims that Russian intelligence operatives have compromising information about him, two U.S. officials said Tuesday evening. They told Reuters the claims, which one called â€œunsubstantiated,â€ were contained in a two-page memo appended to a report on Russian interference in the 2016 election that U.S. intelligence officials presented to Trump and President Barack Obama last week. Trump responded on Tuesday evening in a tweet calling the reports: â€œFAKE NEWS - A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT!â€ The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment. One of the officials, both of whom requested anonymity to discuss classified matters, said the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other U.S. agencies are continuing to investigate the credibility and accuracy of the claims. They are included in opposition research reports made available last year to Democrats and U.S. officials by a former British intelligence official, most of whose past work U.S. officials consider credible. The official said investigators so far have been unable to confirm the material about Trump financial and personal entanglements with Russian businessmen and others whom U.S. intelligence analysts have concluded are Russian intelligence officers or working on behalf of Russian intelligence. Some material in the reports produced by the former British intelligence officer has proved to be erroneous, the official said. The FBI declined comment. The charges that Russia attempted to compromise New York real estate businessman Trump were presented to the FBI and other U.S. government officials last summer and have been circulating for months. The FBI initially took the material seriously, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, which was first reported by CNN.  However, the FBI failed to act on the material, and the former British intelligence officer broke off contact about three weeks before the November election, they said.  The warning of information about Russiaâ€™s compromising claims follows growing U.S. intelligence and law enforcement concerns about what Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has called â€œmultifacetedâ€ Russian influence and espionage operations in Europe and the United States.  In addition to hacking computer networks and spreading propaganda and fake news, it includes efforts to cultivate business and political leaders and find compromising personal, financial and other information on persons of interest, U.S. intelligence officials said. The classified briefings last week were presented to Obama and Trump by Clapper, FBI Director James Comey, Central Intelligence Agency Director John Brennan and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers. U.S. intelligence chiefs included a classified summary of the material to make Trump aware that it is circulating among intelligence agencies, senior members of Congress, government officials and others, one of the officials said. An unclassified intelligence report released on Friday concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an effort to help Trumpâ€™s electoral chances by discrediting Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential campaign. The report said U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that as part of the effort Russiaâ€™s military intelligence agency, the GRU, used intermediaries such as WikiLeaks and others to release emails it hacked from the Democratic National Committee and top Democrats.

Kremlin says it has no compromising dossier on Trump,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Wednesday it was â€œtotal nonsenseâ€ that Russian officials had assembled a file of compromising information on U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Two U.S. officials said on Tuesday evening that the heads of four U.S. intelligence agencies had last week presented Trump with classified documents which included unverified claims that Russian intelligence operatives had compromising information about him. Addressing reporters on a conference call, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the dossier containing the claims was a hoax which had been dreamt up to further harm U.S.-Russia relations, which are already at their lowest level since the Cold War.  â€œIt is an attempt to damage our bilateral relations. It is pulp fiction,â€ said Peskov, who also roundly dismissed as false assertions in the dossier that he himself was heavily involved in running a Russian campaign to undermine defeated presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. â€œYou have to react to this with a certain humor, but thereâ€™s also a sad side to this. Hysteria is being whipped up to maintain a political witch hunt.â€ Peskov said the Kremlin did not engage in compiling compromising dossiers on anyone and was focused on building relations with Russiaâ€™s foreign partners instead. On Tuesday evening, Trump dismissed the reports that Russia had compromising information on him. â€œFAKE NEWS - A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT!â€ he wrote in a Twitter post. Asked to respond to the prospect of new U.S. sanctions affecting Russiaâ€™s oil and gas sector, Peskov said such measures, if they happened, would damage Russia, bilateral ties, and the global economy. The Russian energy sector would definitely get compensation if such sanctions were imposed, he added. Peskov said the Kremlin was unfazed by reports that Trumpâ€™s pick for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, would say at his confirmation hearing on Wednesday that Russia posed a danger. It has previously praised Tillerson, who has experience of working with top Russian officials in the oil sector. Peskov said the Kremlin stood by its assessment of Tillerson as someone who was willing to listen and was constructive, but was aware he was likely to be a tough operator too. â€œWe understand that Tillerson will continue to be quite tough in pursuing his line,â€ said Peskov, saying the Kremlin was not wearing rose-tinted glasses when it came to the former U.S. oilman.

Trump secretary of state choice to say Russia must be held to account,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trumpâ€™s secretary of state nominee, Rex Tillerson, on Wednesday will voice concerns about Russiaâ€™s actions on the world stage and say China must help pressure North Korea to reform. The Trump transition team circulated Tillersonâ€™s opening statement to be delivered during his Senate confirmation hearing. He will explain to some extent why Trump has been in favor of a warmer relationship with Moscow, saying Washington needs an open and frank dialogue with Russia on its ambition in order for the United States to chart its own course. But his rhetoric expressing concern about Russia goes beyond Trumpâ€™s own frequent expressions of the need for better ties after what he feels was a bungling of the relationship by outgoing President Barack Obama. â€œOur NATO allies are right to be alarmed at a resurgent Russia,â€ Tillerson will say. â€œBut it was in the absence of American leadership that this door was left open and unintended signals were sent.â€ He cited Obamaâ€™s failure to act against Syrian President Bashar al-Assadâ€™s use of chemical weapons against his own people after saying in 2012 that doing so would cross a â€œred lineâ€ as a weak signal to Moscow. â€œWe backtracked on commitments we made to allies. We sent weak or mixed signals with â€˜red linesâ€™ that turned into green lights. We did not recognize that Russia does not think like we do,â€ Tillerson will say. Tillerson, like Trump, will express a dim view of Chinaâ€™s aggressive moves in the South China Sea such as its building artificial islands. â€œChinaâ€™s island-building in the South China Sea is an illegal taking of disputed areas without regard for international norms,â€ he will say. As Trump adopts from Obama the challenge of containing North Koreaâ€™s nuclear program, Tillerson signaled a move to exert more pressure on China to help. â€œWe cannot continue to accept empty promises like the ones China has made to pressure North Korea to reform, only to shy away from enforcement. Looking the other way when trust is broken only encourages more bad behavior. And it must end,â€ Tillerson will say. When asked about Tillersonâ€™s comments at a daily briefing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang reiterated that disputes in the South China Sea should be resolved regionally. With reference to North Korea, Lu said: â€œWe care more about peace and stability on the Korean peninsula than any other country.â€ Tillerson will say that challenges posed by Islamic State, China, North Korea and Iran represent new global realities that must be addressed with an assertive United States. â€œTo achieve the stability that is foundational to peace and security in the 21st century, American leadership must not only be renewed, it must be asserted,â€ he will say. The Wall Street Journal reported that Tillerson, the wealthy former CEO of Exxon-Mobil Corp., plans to use an unusual interpretation of U.S. tax law to spread out taxes owed on his retirement package over the next decade instead of paying more than $70 million immediately. The Journal said the move could save Tillerson more than $10 million if Trump gets through the U.S. Congress a tax reform plan that cuts individual tax rates. ",politicsNews,"January 11, 2017 ",Real
Trump rally makes stock options great again for some CEOs,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump once described Jamie Dimon as â€œthe worst banker in the United States,â€ but the president-elect has helped make the boss of JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) $50 million richer. Dimon is the top beneficiary among the 30 chief executives who run companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average index from a stock rally inspired by Trumpâ€™s election, according to a Reuters analysis of their option grants.  Trumpâ€™s proposed policies for lower taxes, less Wall Street regulation and more infrastructure spending have energized the U.S. stock market since the real estate magnateâ€™s Nov. 8 victory.  The post-election rally even resurrected the value of an option award held by Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) CEO Lloyd Blankfein that was worthless on the eve of the election.  Dimon, a lifelong Democrat, has seen his stock options surge in value by more than $50 million to $146 million since the Republican candidateâ€™s White House win.  Trump criticized Dimon in 2013 for reaching a $13 billion settlement with the U.S. government over the sale of toxic mortgages instead of fighting the case. Nevertheless, he appointed Dimon to the Presidentâ€™s Strategic and Policy Forum, a group of high-profile business leaders he set up last month to advise him on economic growth and job creation.  Dimon declined to comment on Trumpâ€™s criticism or the rise in value of his holdings. Stock options held by Dow 30 CEOs surged in value by 23 percent to about $1 billion in 2016, with most of the gain coming after Trumpâ€™s election win.  The figures reflect outstanding stock options that could be exercised at the end of 2015. Options that expired or vested in 2016 were excluded from the analysis.  In a few cases, CEOs exercised some of those options during 2016, U.S. regulatory filings show. Visa Inc (V.N) CEO Charles Scharf did not need a Trump-led stock rally to hit the jackpot. About two weeks before the election, he exercised nearly 800,000 options for gross proceeds of almost $33 million, U.S. regulatory filings show. He resigned from Visa effective Dec. 1. For a look at how the post-election rally has affected Dow 30 stock options, click here (tmsnrt.rs/2iCbvvT)     Trump campaigned on the slogan â€œMake America Great Again,â€ vowing to bolster the prospects of the American working class by preventing jobs from moving abroad, restricting immigration and renegotiating trade pacts. In 2015, Trump called high salaries paid to CEOs a â€œjokeâ€ and a â€œdisgraceâ€ and said these were often approved by company boards stacked with CEOsâ€™ friends. PRO-BUSINESS AGENDA To be sure, Trumpâ€™s election has helped investors big and small. Hopes of a pro-business agenda have driven the Dow 30 close to 20,000 - a level it has never breached - in a boon for workersâ€™ retirement plans. â€œWith the recent Trump/Republican win, it appears that investors are getting more excited about potential growth and animal spirits are on the rise,â€ top investment strategists at Morgan Stanley said this month in a wealth management report. â€œThis is likely to lead to the final euphoric stage of this cyclical bull market which could be quite powerful in 2017â€™s first half.â€    Big stock option gains for Goldman Sachs head Blankfein, American Express Co (AXP.N) CEO Kenneth Chenault and JP Morganâ€™s Dimon may be a surprise, given that their companies have reduced or even eliminated option grants in recent years in favor of stock awards tied to hitting financial targets. Blankfeinâ€™s 322,104 outstanding options, granted in 2007 with a $204.16 strike price, were under water by $7.3 million on the eve of the presidential election. But by the end of 2016, their value had soared to $11.4 million. That was an $18.7 million swing, thanks to the Trump-inspired stock market rally and the U.S. Federal Reserveâ€™s decision to increase interest rates, a boost for banks and credit card companies. Blankfein declined to comment. Alan Johnson, managing director of pay consulting firm Johnson Associates in New York, said the big gains for the leaders of American Express, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan reflect how stock option compensation can magnify gains in a companyâ€™s share price. â€œWhen the stock goes up, with options, you get more leverage,â€ he said. Critics of stock options say the grants can produce large amounts of wealth for CEOs even with mediocre performance. One reason is that grants often are not linked to any financial performance metric, such as return on equity. And so as the United States nears the eighth year of a bull market, options can increase in value even if the CEOs are running companies whose share price has lagged broad benchmarks during their tenure. For example, shares of Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) rose 54 percent during Douglas Oberhelmanâ€™s tenure as CEO of the big equipment maker from mid-2010 to the end of 2016, while the Dow 30 more than doubled during that span.  But the value of Oberhelmanâ€™s options rallied during his last year as CEO, climbing to $20.3 million after being under water by nearly $9 million at the start of 2016. The optionsâ€™ value got a $10.6 million booster shot after Trumpâ€™s victory. Caterpillar shares rose 36 percent in 2016, making it one of the best performing stocks on the Dow. Trump has said he would use Caterpillar tractors to build a wall between the United States and Mexico. Caterpillar and Oberhelman declined to comment. Not all CEOs have been winners, however. Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) CEO Muhtar Kent, who contributed $2,700 to Hillary Clinton, Trumpâ€™s Democratic rival for president, saw the value of his options decline by $11.3 million to $143 million.  Coca-Cola shares are off 3 percent since Trump was elected amid lingering concerns about consumers cutting their consumption of sugary drinks. A Coca-Cola spokesman declined to comment.

Bill on tallying up regulation costs wins U.S. financial industry backing,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Financial lobbyists on Tuesday applauded a bill in the U.S. House of Representatives that would require the Securities and Exchange Commission to review the costs of rules before putting them into force, which is part of a broader push from Republicans to reform regulation. The legislation, introduced by Missouri Republican Ann Wagner, the newly minted chair of the financial services oversight subcommittee, is expected to go to the floor of the House on Thursday for a vote.  â€œThe U.S. capital markets are the envy of the world and we believe it is critical to study any economic impact of a proposed rulemaking prior to its completion to protect investors, protect capital formation, and protect our markets,â€ said the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, Wall Streetâ€™s primary trade group, in a letter to House leadership. The group added the bill would also require the SEC to periodically review its existing rules and analyze the effectiveness of its regulation.  Also on Thursday, a bill requiring the major derivatives regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to review costs of its proposals is scheduled to come to the House floor. Both bills come as Republicans work toward a broader overhaul of federal regulation. Banks, asset managers and others in the financial sector have said that regulations can often lead to unintended expenses and that there should be a way to understand how regulations from a variety of areas fit together when it comes to compliance costs.   The bills are expected to pass the House, which has approved similar measures that outgoing President Barack Obama, a Democrat, opposed. Currently, there is no companion legislation in the Senate. President-elect Donald Trump, a Republican, frequently said on the campaign trail that the costs of complying with federal regulation can hurt companiesâ€™ bottom lines. The SEC is already required to weigh the impact of its rules on efficiency, competition and capital formation. It beefed up efforts in recent years and issued new guidance on the subject after business groups including the Chamber of Commerce successfully beat back some rules in federal court. Wagnerâ€™s bill would go beyond those requirements in its enhanced cost-benefit analysis and existing rule review. It would also require the SEC to clearly identify the nature of the problems new rules are intended to solve. An SEC spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on it.

Russia hacked Republican state campaigns but not Trump's: FBI head,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russia hacked into Republican state political campaigns and old email domains of the Republican National Committee but there is no evidence it successfully penetrated President-elect Donald Trumpâ€™s campaign, FBI Director James Comey said on Tuesday. Comey also told lawmakers Russia did not release information obtained from the state campaigns or the old RNC email domains, comments that may buttress the U.S. intelligence view that Moscow tried to help Trump against Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign. U.S. intelligence agencies on Friday released an assessment that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a covert effort to help Republican Trumpâ€™s electoral chances by discrediting Clinton.      The report, which omitted classified details, was the U.S. governmentâ€™s starkest public description of what it says was a Russian effort to manipulate the American electoral process by leaking hacked emails from Democrats. Russia has denied interfering in the election but President Barack Obama expelled 35 Russian suspected spies from the United States and imposed sanctions on two Russian intelligence agencies last month in response to the allegations. Defense Secretary Ash Carter told a news conference on Tuesday those penalties were â€œa start and not the endâ€ of U.S. retaliation for the hacks, and senior officials have suggested covert action may be taken. Comey told lawmakers the Federal Bureau of Investigation  â€œdid not develop any evidence that the Trump campaign, or the current RNC, was successfully hacked.â€ He did not say whether Russia had tried to hack Trumpâ€™s campaign.        Trump has disputed the accusations of Russian cyber attacks during the election, but his incoming chief of staff said on Sunday that the New York businessman accepts the U.S. intelligence communityâ€™s conclusions that Russia was responsible, and that further action may be taken against Moscow. Comey declined to comment on whether or not the FBI might be investigating links between Russia and associates of Trump, who frequently called during the campaign for improved relations between Washington and Moscow.  The FBI director was pressed by Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, to publicly provide a declassified answer to the question before Jan. 20, the day Trump will be inaugurated, but Comey suggested he would unable to do so.             Comey appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee along with the director of national intelligence, the head of the Central Intelligence Agency and the chief of the National Security Agency at a time of controversy in Washington about the 2016 election. Testifying before Congress for the first time since Trump beat Clinton on Nov. 8, Comey has been criticized by Democrats for statements about a separate investigation into Clintonâ€™s use of a private email server as secretary of state. The controversy over Russiaâ€™s alleged role in attempting to influence the election has roiled Washington, with Democratic lawmakers calling for an independent commission to investigate the matter and Republicans worried that the affair might call into question the legitimacy of Trumpâ€™s victory. Comey said there was evidence Russia hacked Republican state-level political campaigns and â€œoldâ€ email domains that the RNC was no longer using. In contrast, Fridayâ€™s report assessed that Russian military intelligence used intermediaries such as WikiLeaks, DCLeaks.com and the Guccifer 2.0 â€œpersonaâ€ to release emails that it had acquired from the Democratic National Committee and top Democrats as part of the effort to help Trump and harm Clinton.     The DNC denied â€œmultiple requestsâ€ made by the FBI to examine its hacked servers, Comey said. He added that his agents relied on a forensic analysis conducted by the cyber security firm CrowdStrike, which was hired by the DNC to help clean up the hack when it was detected last spring.    Senior U.S. Republican and Democratic senators introduced legislation on Tuesday seeking to impose a wide range of sanctions on Russia over its cyber activities and actions in Syria and Ukraine.

Trump's choice for U.S. attorney general says he can stand up to him,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trumpâ€™s pick for attorney general, Jeff Sessions, promised on Tuesday to stand up to Trump, his close ally and future boss, saying he would oppose a ban on Muslims entering the country and enforce a law against waterboarding even though he voted against the measure. Questioned for 10-1/2 hours by a U.S. Senate committee responsible for confirming his appointment, Sessions, a U.S. senator from Alabama, distanced himself from comments he had made defending Trump from criticism over a 2005 video that emerged in October showing Trump boasting about grabbing womenâ€™s genitals. At the time, Sessions told The Weekly Standard magazine he would not characterize the behavior as sexual assault. He later said the comments were taken out of context. Asked on Tuesday whether â€œgrabbing a woman by her genitals without consent is ... sexual assault,â€ he replied: â€œClearly, it would be.â€ With 10 days to go before Trump takes office, Sessions, 70, was the first Cabinet nominee to face questioning. He appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Trumpâ€™s pick to run the Department of Homeland Security, retired Marine Corps General John Kelly, later went before the Homeland Security Committee. As attorney general, Sessions would serve as the top U.S. law enforcement officer and be responsible for giving unbiased legal advice to the president and executive agencies.     With that in mind, lawmakers from both Trumpâ€™s Republican Party and the Democratic Party sought to establish how closely Sessions hewed to Trump positions and whether he could put aside his staunchly conservative political positions to enforce laws he may personally oppose.     A senator since 1997, Sessions was widely expected to be confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate.  Protesters accusing Sessions of having a poor record on human rights interrupted the Capitol Hill proceedings several times. Sessions said he would not support banning anyone from the United States on the basis of religion and that Trumpâ€™s intentions were to restrict people from countries harboring terrorists, not all Muslims. Elected on Nov. 8, Trump at one point campaigned on a proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country.  Sessions said he favored â€œhigher intensity of vettingâ€ for refugees seeking to enter the United States from countries that harbor terrorists but that he would oppose ending the U.S. refugee program. He also said he would enforce a 2015 law that outlawed waterboarding terrorism suspects even if it meant resisting Trump. The senator said he had voted against the law, believing those in high positions in the military and intelligence community should be able to do so.    During the campaign, Trump said waterboarding, which simulates drowning and is widely regarded as torture, was an effective technique and vowed to bring it back and make it â€œa hell of a lot worse.â€ More recently Trump has said retired Marine Corps General James Mattis, his nominee for secretary of defense, had persuasively argued against it.     Sessions said he would enforce laws upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, even those he disagreed with, such as decisions making abortion and same-sex marriage legal. Sessions said the comments he made during the 2016 presidential campaign about Democrat Hillary Clintonâ€™s email practices and charitable foundation would cloud the perception of impartiality if the Justice Department continued investigating Clinton. He said he would recuse himself and favored a special prosecutor to carry out any future investigations.  Trump, who defeated Clinton, said during the campaign that if elected, he would ask his attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor to see that Clinton go to prison for her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state and her relationship with her familyâ€™s charitable foundation.      Sessions said he agreed with Trump in opposing Democratic President Barack Obamaâ€™s executive action that granted temporary protection to immigrant children brought to the country illegally by their parents and would not oppose overturning it. Sessions, representing the deeply conservative Southern state of Alabama, has long opposed legislation that provides a path to citizenship for immigrants. He has also been a close ally of groups seeking to restrict legal immigration by placing limits on visas used by companies to hire foreign workers.  Sessions said he would be more aggressive in investigating and prosecuting abuses of the H-1B visa program, which he said allows companies to discriminate against American workers by hiring foreigners.  As head of the Justice Department, the attorney general oversees the immigration court system that decides whether immigrants are deported or granted asylum or some other kind of protection. Sessions renewed his criticism of the Obama administration for not being tougher on countries that refuse to take back criminal migrants ordered deported from the United States.  A key plank of Trumpâ€™s election campaign was his pledge to deport illegal immigrants and build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. Kelly told his hearing a physical barrier on its own is not enough to keep people and drugs from illegally entering the United States. In written testimony, Kelly said that â€œrapidly processingâ€ and deporting immigrants in â€œsignificant numbersâ€ would deter future illegal migration. The U.S. immigration court system has a backlog of over 500,000 cases awaiting a decision on deportation, asylum or some other kind of protection. Many migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border are given a notice to appear in court one to three years in the future.  Before the Judiciary Committee, Sessions several times defended himself against charges of racism. He said allegations that he harbored sympathies toward the Ku Klux Klan, a violent white supremacist organization, were false.  â€œI abhor the Klan and what it represents and its hateful ideology,â€ Sessions said in his opening remarks. Sessions was denied confirmation to a federal judgeship in 1986 after allegations emerged that he made racist remarks, including testimony that he called an African-American prosecutor â€œboy,â€ an allegation Sessions denied.   Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said the Senate Judiciary Committee had received letters from 400 civil rights organizations opposing his confirmation to the countryâ€™s top law enforcement post.

"Clinton, other former top diplomats mark new diplomacy center","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Four current and former U.S. secretaries of state, including Hillary Clinton, gathered at the State Department on Tuesday to mark the ceremonial opening of a museum on American diplomacy. The privately funded U.S. Diplomacy Center will formally open in 2018. It includes an exhibition hall named after Clinton, who lost the November presidential election to Republican Donald Trump. Other halls in the nonpartisan center are named for U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and predecessors Henry Kissinger and James Baker.  In the light-filled hall named in Clintonâ€™s honor, marked by glass walls and a glass roof, she joked that it â€œis the most transparent partâ€ of the center, an apparent reference to the controversy over her use of a private email server which dogged her presidential ambitions. In her brief remarks, Clinton did not mention Trump or the campaign. She said that democracy, freedom and the rule of law were under attack around the world and that the world faced â€œa rising tide of authoritarianism and illiberalism.â€ â€œThe longstanding bipartisan goal of a Europe that is whole, free and at peace is under enormous pressure,â€ she said. â€œWe should remember that the world looks to America as the indispensable nation not just because of the size of our military or the strength of our economy,â€ she said. â€œIt looks to us because America stands for universal values and aspirations. And if we stay true to those values like the best of the men and women whose leadership and service will be commemorated here, then our country will weather every storm on the horizon.â€ Former top U.S. diplomats Madeleine Albright, who will donate her personal collection of more than 200 pins to the center, and Colin Powell also spoke at the ceremony.  Supporters of the center include private American companies Boeing Co, Intel Corp and FedEx Corp; the Kuwaiti, Qatari, United Arab Emirates and Brunei governments; and the Clinton Family Foundation, according to a panel in the exhibition hall. Nearly $48 million in private sector funds have been raised for the center, and $18 million more is needed, according to the website of the Diplomacy Center Foundation created to support the museum.

China jails 44 Taiwanese for fraud in case denounced by Taipei,"BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) - A Beijing court on Thursday handed down jail sentences of up to 15 years to 85 people deported from Kenya for telecoms fraud, including 44 from self-ruled Taiwan, an island Beijing claims as its own which said vital evidence had been ignored. Over the past two years, countries including Kenya, Spain, Vietnam and Cambodia have deported hundreds of people from Taiwan to China for telecoms fraud, sparking accusations from Taipei that Beijing was effectively kidnapping its citizens. China has defended the deportations, saying the crimes were committed against people in China and that as Taiwan is a part of China. The Beijing court said in a statement that one of the Taiwanese, Chang Kai-min, had been jailed for 15 years for helping scam 185 people out of more than 29 million yuan ($4.4 million). Taiwan s China policy-making Mainland Affairs Council said Taiwan and China had initially agreed to cooperate in investigating the Kenya case, but China had gone back on its word. The outside world could only believe justice had been done if the case had fully considered all the evidence and gone through proper legal procedure, the council added.  In this case, we obtained intelligence on the criminal suspects behind the scenes,  it said.  We again call on the mainland China side to cooperate with our public security organs, investigate the origins and not allow the masterminds behind the scenes to get away with it.  On at least two occasions last year, Kenya deported groups of Taiwanese to China. In one case, a Kenyan magistrate said the Taiwanese should be repatriated to their place of origin, Taiwan, but the Kenyan government sent them to China. Kenya, like most countries, only has diplomatic relations with China. Beijing considers democratic Taiwan a wayward province, ineligible for formal ties with other nations. Chinese authorities have sought to contain an explosion of telecom crime it says has led to huge financial losses, with callers often impersonating officials or authority figures and preying on the elderly, students or the unemployed. The fraud has spread overseas, with Chinese speakers recruited in neighboring Taiwan increasingly setting up operations in East Africa or Southeast Asia. The deportations have come as relations between Beijing and Taipei have deteriorated, with China suspecting Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen of pushing for the island s formal independence. She says she wants to maintain peace with China but will defend Taiwan s security and democracy. ",worldnews,"December 21, 2017 ",Real
"Peru president, crying 'coup,' signals VPs would quit if he ousted","LIMA (Reuters) - Peru s President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski on Wednesday signaled both his vice presidents would resign if Congress forced him from office, calling an opposition bid to remove him a  coup  attempt that had to be resisted. The rightwing populist party that controls Congress, Popular Force, aims to oust Kuczynski in a vote on Thursday on grounds he is  morally unfit  to govern, after finding he once had business connections with a company at the center of Latin America s biggest graft scandal. Kuczynski, who denies anything improper or illegal, said Popular Force was misusing its majority to attempt a power grab.  The constitution and democracy are under attack. We re facing a coup dressed in supposedly legitimate legal interpretations,  he said in a late night speech on national television.  This is a conviction that my two vice presidents share, because neither wants to be part of a government born of an unjust and anti-democratic maneuver,  Kuczynski said. He was flanked by First Vice President Martin Vizcarra and Second Vice President Mercedes Araoz. If Kuczynski loses Thursday s congressional vote to remove him and his two vice presidents depart as well, new presidential and legislative elections would be called. A 79-year-old former Wall Street banker, Kuczynski has struggled to govern since winning last year s presidential election but only a small share of congressional seats for his center-right party. Popular Force says its efforts to remove him are well within the bounds of the constitution and key to its fight against corruption.  He simply doesn t care about the country,  Popular Force lawmaker Luz Salgado said after Kuczynski s address. Earlier this week, Salgado called for Vizcarra to govern the country through 2021, when Kucyznski s term ends. Vizcarra and Araoz both pledged their loyalty to the center-right president on Wednesday but declined to comment on whether that meant they would resign if he was removed from office. Araoz told Reuters on Sunday that she and Vizcarra would not quit. In recent days, Kuczynski s supporters have increasingly called for his vice presidents to refuse to replace him. They believe new elections would cost Popular Force its majority amid widespread contempt for elected officials as a graft scandal taints much of the country s political class. But investors worry a new ballot could sweep anti-establishment candidates to power in one of Latin America s most stable economies. Kuczynski s government does not think it will come to that, said a government source. It expects about a dozen opposition lawmakers to oppose the motion or abstain from voting, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Eighty-seven votes are needed to oust Kuczynski. Congress passed the motion to start  presidential vacancy  proceedings last week with 93 votes. On Wednesday, thousands of Peruvians marched in front of Congress to denounce what they saw as Popular Force s bid to exploit the crisis to sabotage country s democratic institutions, pointing to its recent efforts to also oust the attorney general and a justice in the Constitutional Court. Popular Force emerged from the rightwing populist movement started in the 1990s by former President Alberto Fujimori, who is serving a 25-year-sentence for graft and human rights crimes during his autocratic 1990-2000 government. The United States, where Kuczynski once held citizenship, said Peru was a  strong democracy.   We are confident that the Peruvian people and institutions will address this situation according to Peru s constitutional norms,  the U.S. State Department s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs said. The political crisis stems from a disclosure by Brazilian builder Odebrecht [ODBES.UL], which has landed elites in jail from Colombia to the Dominican Republic since acknowledging bribing officials across the region for much of the century. Responding to a request by Congress, Odebrecht said it paid more than $4 million to consulting companies owned by Kuczynski or a close business associate for about a decade starting in 2004. Some deposits were made to a company Kuczynski owned while he was minister in a government that awarded Odebrecht lucrative contracts. Odebrecht said Saturday that there was no indication the transactions were part of its past corrupt dealings with politicians, which it can only discuss with prosecutors. Kuczynski once strenuously denied ever having any ties with Odebrecht. He has since apologized to Peru for not disclosing his connections with the company, blaming forgetfulness and poor organization of his personal records after decades of work in finance and public administration. But he said there was nothing improper about the payments.  Being careless and sloppy is a defect but it is not...a tool for dishonesty and much, much less, for crime,  Kuczynski said. Kuczynski had once raised hopes that his decades of finance and public administration experience would usher in a new period of investments to spur faster economic growth in the world s No.2 copper producer. But in a sign of how the crisis has engulfed his government, Peru postponed an auction of a $2 billion copper project, scheduled for Wednesday, until February.  ",worldnews,"December 20, 2017 ",Real

Myanmar bars U.N. rights investigator before visit,"GENEVA (Reuters) - The U.N. independent investigator into human rights in Myanmar called on Wednesday for stronger international pressure to be exerted on Myanmar s military commanders after being barred from visiting the country for the rest of her tenure.  Yanghee Lee, U.N. special rapporteur, had been due to visit in January to assess human rights across Myanmar, including alleged abuses against Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine State. But Myanmar had told her she was no longer welcome, she said, adding in a statement that this suggested something  terribly awful  was happening in the country.   From what I see right now I m not sure if they are feeling pressured. I m not sure if there is the right kind of pressure placed on the military commanders and the generals,  she later told Reuters by telephone from Seoul. She said it was alarming that Myanmar was strongly supported by China, which has a veto at the U.N. s top table in New York. Other countries including the United States and human groups were advocating targeted sanctions on the military, she said.  It has to work. And I m sure the world has to find a way to make it work. And I think the United Nations and its member states should really try to persuade China to really act towards the protection of human rights,  she said. Surveys of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh by aid agency Medecins Sans Frontieres have shown at least 6,700 Rohingya were killed in Rakhine state in the month after violence flared up on Aug 25, the aid group said last week. More than 650,000 Rohingya have fled into Bangladesh since Aug. 25, when attacks by Muslim insurgents on the Myanmar security forces triggered a sweeping response by the army and Buddhist vigilantes. Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the situation in Rakhine State was an internal affair for Myanmar with its own complex history. Myanmar and Bangladesh resolving this issue was the only way to go, she told reporters. The international community should provide constructive help for Myanmar and Bangladesh to resolve the issue rather than complicating it, Hua added. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra ad al-Hussein has called the violence  a textbook example of ethnic cleansing  and said he would not be surprised if a court eventually ruled that genocide had taken place.     Lee had planned to use her visit to find out procedures for the return of Rohingya refugees, and to investigate increased fighting in Kachin State and Shan Sate in northern Myanmar, where the military is battling autonomy-seeking ethic minority guerrillas. Lee, in an earlier statement, said Myanmar s refusal to cooperate with her was a strong indication that there must be  something terribly awful happening  throughout the country, although the government had repeatedly denied any violations of human rights.  They have said that they have nothing to hide, but their lack of cooperation with my mandate and the fact-finding mission suggests otherwise,  she said. She was  puzzled and disappointed , since Myanmar s ambassador in Geneva, Htin Lynn, had told the U.N. Human Rights Council only two weeks ago that it would cooperate.  Now I am being told that this decision to no longer cooperate with me is based on the statement I made after I visited the country in July,  she said. Htin Lynn did not respond to a request for comment. Neither Zaw Htay, spokesman for Myanmar government leader Aung San Suu Kyi, nor Kyaw Moe Tun, a spokesman for the ministry of foreign affairs that Suu Kyi heads, were immediately available.

Dying for a paycheck: the Russian civilians fighting in Syria,"ORENBURG, Russia (Reuters) - When Vladimir Kabunin signed up as a private military contractor, he saw a chance to make a wage much higher than any he could earn in his provincial Russian hometown. Happy to be able to support his wife and son, the ex-police officer left Orenburg, nearly 1,500 km (940 miles) southeast of Moscow, and joined pro-Russian rebels fighting government forces in east Ukraine, a family friend and a relative told Reuters.  When fighting subsided there, he went to Syria to serve as a field medic with troops under Russian command, they said. Kabunin was killed in Syria this year and his body was sent home, they said. But the government does not recognize he was in Syria, so he was buried without military honors and nothing on his grave shows he was killed in action. Kabunin, who was 38, was one of hundreds of military contractors secretly recruited by Moscow for combat operations in Syria since Russia s military operation began there in 2015, according to people familiar with the deployment. According to a Reuters tally based on accounts from people who knew the deceased and local officials, at least 28 private contractors have been killed in Syria this year, and Russian consular documents seen by Reuters suggest the figure may be much higher.   The government denies recruiting and sending private military contractors to fight abroad. The defense ministry did not respond when asked about Kabunin s case and the role of contractors in Syria, and has said previous Reuters reports on the contractors are an attempt to discredit Russia s mission to restore peace to Syria.     But over two years, Reuters has spoken to dozens of family members, colleagues and friends of military contractors who have been killed in Syria. Those familiar with the deployment say the contractors are under government command and have helped turn the tide of war in favor of Russia s ally, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, while hiding the scale of its military involvement and losses. The fact that Kabunin and others like him are willing to sign up for such missions shows the Kremlin can draw on a large reserve of fighters who, as long as they are well remunerated, are willing to risk dying in the shadows. WELL-TRODDEN PATH Kabunin followed a path taken by many contractors: service in the military or security forces, a return to civilian life, a struggle to make a living, then a chance to make decent money fighting secretly for Russia, in Ukraine and then Syria. Family members of Russian contractors say that in Syria they were paid up to $6,500 per month, which exceeds Russia s average monthly wage more than 12 times.  If you quit law enforcement bodies, you have only one way (choice) - to become a mercenary,  Vasily Karkan, a classmate of Kabunin at school, told Reuters.   Kabunin was shy as a child until he started kickboxing classes, Karkan recalled. The sport became a life-long hobby. Kabunin obtained a degree in medicine and also studied law, but followed in the family footsteps by joining the police.  In 2010, he found a new job in a prison, where his wife also worked in a tuberculosis hospital. Kabunin s role was to work with prisoners to obtain information and gather intelligence on planned escape attempts or potential unrest, but he left that job in 2012.  A spokesman for Orenburg prisons service said he had left of his own volition. A family friend spoke of job cuts and said he looked for a new job for about two years.  There is no place to work,  the family friend said.  You can t earn more than 10,000 rubles ($170)(a month) here.  When fighting broke out in eastern Ukraine in 2014, Kabunin saw a job opportunity. Moscow denies deploying active service troops in Ukraine or providing direct military help to the separatists. But Kabunin signed up with Dmitry Utkin, the leader of a group of Russian ex-servicemen fighting there who uses the nom de guerre  Vagner , and, drawing on his medical degree, served as a military medic, his relative said. When Utkin and his comrades deployed to Syria in support of Russia s regular forces, Kabunin went with them, people familiar with the deployment said. As of April 2016, he was a field medic in a medical evacuation unit under Utkin s command in Syria, according to an official in a Ukrainian law enforcement agency. The agency says it has obtained the personnel records of 1,700 Russian contractors deployed in Syria, most of whom were earlier in Ukraine.  Kabunin left home for his last trip to Syria on Jan. 4 and was put in command of a medical company, but was wounded on Jan. 31 and died on Feb. 7 in Homs province, a relative said. The relative knew this from former police colleagues of Kabunin, some of whom also served in Syria, and from his death certificate, which was handed to his wife Natalya. It was not clear how she was informed and who gave her the death certificate. She declined to speak to Reuters.  Relatives of other killed contractors say the news has come via friends or acquaintances, or by phone from people who say they represent a private company. Kabunin was buried next to other family members  graves in Orenburg, his portrait displayed on a cross showing a man with a shaved head in civilian clothes. His wife received a compensation payment, according to the relative, who gave no further details. According to accounts from relatives of other contractors killed in Syria, the employer typically pays out 3 million rubles ($51,227) in compensation to the next of kin when a contractor is killed. Relatives of another dead contractor told Reuters that, in his case, the money was handed over to his widow in cash in a hotel in the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don. On a visit to Syria on Dec. 11, President Vladimir Putin declared mission accomplished for the Syrian operation and paid tribute to Russian servicemen who have been killed there. There was no mention of the contractors  losses. The government is under no obligation to disclose the deaths of non-regular forces fighting under its command and Russian military losses in Syria are a state secret. Kabunin s death did not dissuade his friend Valery Dzyuba, also a former police officer and kickboxer from Orenburg, from heading to Syria to fight as a military contractor. Dzyuba s family received a phone call from an unidentified man saying he had died on Aug. 20 but not specifying the circumstances. Dzyuba was killed in Syria, according to one of his classmates, Kabunin s relative and an official in the village where Dzyuba was buried. ",worldnews,"December 21, 2017 ",Real
Australia finds wreck of first Allied submarine to sink in World War One,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia has discovered the wreck of its first submarine off the coast of Papua New Guinea, authorities said on Thursday, resolving one of the country s oldest naval mysteries after more than a century.

U.S. creating 'sensational hype' over China's military modernization: ministry,"BEIJING (Reuters) - The United States has created  sensational hype  over China s military modernization, the defense ministry has said in reaction to a White House report branding China a competitor seeking to challenge U.S. power. U.S. President Donald Trump s administration on Monday laid out a national security strategy based on Trump s  America First  vision, singling out of China and Russia as  revisionist powers  seeking not only to challenge U.S. power but to erode its security and prosperity. China s foreign ministry said on Tuesday cooperation between China and the United States was the only correct choice. The spokesman for its defense ministry, Ren Guoqiang, said in a statement posted on the ministry website late on Wednesday that the U.S. strategy had  without regard for the facts, created sensational hype over the modernization of China s defenses . Ren also said the strategy had  called into question the intentions of China s military development plan  and that it ran counter to peace worldwide and the development of China s relations with the United States. China s contribution to world peace was plain for all to see, he said.  Attempts by any country or any document to distort the facts or cast aspersions will be in vain,  Ren said. China s armed forces, the world s largest, are in the midst of an ambitious modernization program, which includes investment in technology and new equipment such as stealth fighters and aircraft carriers, as well as cuts to troop numbers. The tough U.S. national security strategy comes after   Trump has sought to build strong relations with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Trump has called upon Xi to ensure China does more to help the United States rein in North Korea s nuclear and missile programs. The U.S. administration cited China s growing military might and its efforts to build military bases on manmade islands in the contested South China Sea as evidence of Chinese attempts to alter the status quo. China says its expansion of islets in the South China Sea is for peaceful purposes only and that, as it has irrefutable sovereignty there, no other country has the right to question its actions.

Indonesian police warn Islamists against raids in search of Santa hats,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian police appealed on Thursday for tolerance and respect for other people s religious celebrations after an Islamist group threatened to raid businesses to check for Muslims being forced to wear Santa Claus hats or other Christmas garb. The hardline Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) said this week it would conduct  sweeping operations  in the world s biggest Muslim-majority country, and that forcing Muslims to wear Christmas attire was a violation of their human rights. Indonesia is home to several religious minorities, including Christians, Hindus, Buddhists and people who follow traditional beliefs.  The constitution guarantees freedom of religion in an officially secular state though tension between followers of different faiths can flare.  There can be no sweeping operations ... members of the public should respect other religions that are carrying out celebrations,  national police chief Tito Karnavian told police  during a security exercise in the capital, Jakarta. The FPI said it aimed to enforce a fatwa, or decree, issued by Indonesia s Islamic Clerical Council in 2016 prohibiting business owners from forcing employees to wear Christmas clothing.      We will raid businesses in anticipation of them being stubborn about this and we will be accompanied by police,  said Novel Bakmukmin, head of the FPI s Jakarta chapter.  Employers forcing staff to wear Christmas clothes were violating their rights.  Businesses should be aware that there should be no forcing,  he said. The Islamic Clerical Council s decrees are not legally binding but serve as guidelines for Indonesian Muslims.         Christmas is widely celebrated across Indonesia and holiday decorations are ubiquitous, especially at shops, restaurants and malls where many enthusiastic workers - even Muslims - don Santa hats or elf costumes. The FPI built its reputation with raids on restaurants and bars serving alcohol during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. In recent years, it has turned its attention to Christian celebrations. The group has also said it wants the Jakarta city government to stop sponsoring New Year celebrations, which attract many thousands of people. About 90,000 police officers will be on duty cross the country during the end-of-year holidays, in an operation largely aimed at preventing militant attacks.  Attacks on churches in Jakarta and elsewhere on Christmas Eve in 2000, killed nearly 20 people. Ever since, authorities have stepped up security at churches and tourist spots for the holiday.

South Korean 'nut rage' executive remains free after court upholds suspended sentence,"SEOUL (Reuters) - A former Korean Air Lines executive who went into a rage on an aircraft over the way she was served nuts in first class avoided jail on Thursday when South Korea s Supreme Court upheld her 10-month suspended sentence. Heather Cho had been charged with, among others, violation of aviation law in 2015 after she took issue with the way she was served nuts and forced the Korean Air Lines plane to return to its gate in a New York airport in December 2014. The incident became a national scandal in South Korea, as Cho is the daughter of the chairman of Hanjin Group, the conglomerate of which Korean Air is an affiliate. Cho stepped down from her role as Korean Air Lines vice president and attempted to apologize to crew members.  The Supreme Court upheld an appeals court ruling that said forcing an on-the-ground plane to return to its gate cannot be seen as  route deviation,  but found Cho guilty of abusive language and actions against cabin crew and forcing a crew member to disembark.  Cho was originally sentenced to one year in jail, but has been free from custody since May 2015, when the appeals court suspended her sentence. ",worldnews,"December 21, 2017 ",Real
Exclusive: China's border city with North Korea eases tourism curbs - sources,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese tourists are still visiting Pyongyang from China s border city of Dandong, tourism sources say, even after authorities unofficially halted the tours just ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump s visit to China last month.  A group of 40 Chinese tourists left on Friday from the border city of Dandong to Pyongyang, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters, a sign local authorities have not been strongly enforcing curbs on tourist flows.   This is the largest group to go in from Dandong since the curb,  a tour operator said, adding the tourists traveled by train into North Korea for a four-day tour. The Dandong Tourism Bureau declined to be interviewed for this story. When asked for comment, China s foreign ministry said they did  not understand the situation.  Local businesses in China are known to find ways around policies introduced by local authorities or Beijing, whether in good times or bad.   There s always a way around government policies,  said one Dandong-based tourism source.  You know how Chinese people are.    I think the central government will be very annoyed at Dandong for lifting the travel restriction,  the tour operator said. MONEY-MAKER FOR NORTH Tourism to North Korea is not banned by the United Nations and is one of the few remaining ways that North Korea earns hard currency. The Korea Maritime Institute, a South Korean think-tank, estimates that tourism generates about $44 million in annual revenue for North Korea.  The U.N. has ramped up sanctions over North Korea s accelerating missile program over the past year, curbing key export industries including coal, seafood and textiles. Simon Cockerell, head of Beijing-based Koryo Tours which organizes travel to North Korea, said he saw 3 to 4 busloads of Chinese tourists in Pyongyang in mid-November.  But I m not sure where they entered from or what visas they were on,  he said.   If you have a visa to North Korea, it doesn t say where you can and can t go. So once you enter into Sinuiju or Rason, you could travel onwards to Pyongyang. The North Koreans wouldn t care,  Cockerell said.  Sinuiju and Rason are popular entry points for Chinese tourists traveling overland into North Korea. China never publicly announced a ban on Chinese tourists visiting Pyongyang and strongly opposes unilateral sanctions, which it says undermines U.N. unity. But the day before U.S President Donald Trump s first official visit to China in early November, Reuters exclusively reported that the Dandong Tourism Bureau had told Chinese tour operators based in Dandong to halt trips to North Korea s capital of Pyongyang. Trump has frequently praised Chinese President Xi Jinping Trump with whom he has been working to exert pressure on North Korea through strict enforcement of sanctions over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Dandong, a city of 800,000 people in northeastern Liaoning province, is the main trading hub on the Chinese side of the border and most tour companies that take Chinese tourists to North Korea are based there. The U.N. sanctions have particularly hit Dandong s economy this year. Almost all tours to North Korea have stopped and many Dandong-based companies who traditionally conducted business with North Korea are struggling, sources told Reuters.   A lot of the more successful Chinese businessmen have gone on holidays because there s nothing for them to do around here at the moment,  said one Chinese businessman in Dandong.  China s trade with North Korea has already fallen to its lowest in months. Beijing has repeatedly said it is rigorously enforcing U.N. resolutions aimed at reining in Pyongyang s missile and nuclear programs. North Korea has accelerated the pace of its missile tests this year. Pyongyang said its latest test on Nov. 28 was an intercontinental ballistic missile that it said could deliver heavy nuclear warheads anywhere in the continental United States.

Mexico arrests former high-ranking PRI official in corruption probe,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican authorities on Wednesday arrested a former high-ranking official of President Enrique Pena Nieto s party in a corruption investigation in the northern state of Chihuahua, the state s governor said. The arrest extends a streak of corruption allegations dogging the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), with four former governors arrested on such charges this year. Entrenched corruption is expected to be a key issue in the runup to Mexico s next presidential election in 2018. Alejandro Gutierrez, who was the adjunct secretary to the presidency of the PRI, was arrested in a joint operation by state and federal police, Chihuahua Governor Javier Corral wrote in a post on Facebook. The Chihuahua prosecutor s office accused Gutierrez of participating in a  sophisticated scheme  to divert public funds of 250 million pesos ($13 million) earmarked for educational programs in 2016. Gutierrez will present himself before a judge early Thursday, the office said in a statement. This week, Mexican newspaper Reforma published reports on an alleged Chihuahua corruption scheme to funnel the money into the PRI s campaign fund, through avenues such as fake contracts for workshops for parents and expensive software. The reports were based on testimony to prosecutors by former state finance minister Jaime Herrera that the paper obtained.  Gutierrez  arrest took place in Coahuila. This week, he rejected allegations against him in an interview with Mexican newspaper Vanguardia, saying he was considering suing for defamation.  I am thinking, I will have to look into it, if I initiate some legal proceeding,  he said.  I do not know, I repeat to you, I did not know not even one official, nor ex-official, of finances... I see things that are absolutely false.  Gutierrez  arrest  contributes to the clearing up of the crimes of political corruption that have been attributed to the former governor, C sar Duarte J quez,  said Corral, of the National Action Party.   The government is determining whether others should be held responsible for the funneling of funds to PRI coffers in 2016, Corral added. In March, a Mexican judge issued an arrest warrant for Duarte on suspicion of embezzlement. Corral has said he is a fugitive from justice. A spokesman for the PRI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The PRI was routed in 2016 regional elections, losing several of its bastions, including the states of Veracruz, Tamaulipas and Quintana Roo, as voters expressed discontent over a series of graft scandals.

As we have clearly stated on several occasions, we have nothing to do with cyber attack and we do not feel a need to respond, on a case-by-case basis, to such absurd allegations of the U.S.,  the spokesman said, according to the North s official KCNA news agency.

U.S. approves license for Ukraine to buy small arms from U.S. firms,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has approved an export license for Ukraine to buy certain light weapons and small arms from U.S. manufacturers, spokeswoman Heather Nauert said on Wednesday. Department records show Ukraine has bought small amounts of those types of weapons for several years, both before and after the 2014 Russian annexation of Ukraine s Crimean peninsula. The department notified Congress of the decision on Dec. 13, Nauert said, adding that the U.S. government was not selling the weapons directly to the Kiev government but was allowing Ukraine to buy from U.S. manufacturers.   Under the previous two administrations, the U.S. government has approved export licenses to Ukraine, so this is nothing new,  Nauert said. The license covers weapons in categories such as semi-automatic and automatic firearms up to, and including, .50 caliber weapons. It also includes combat shotguns, silencers, military scopes, and flash suppressors, as well as parts. Nauert said the U.S. government had not directly provided lethal defensive equipment to Ukraine, nor had it ruled out doing so. U.S. exporters can apply for direct commercial sales licenses at any time and those are reviewed by the State Department on a case-by-case basis, she said. ",worldnews,"December 21, 2017 ",Real
Venezuela may ban main opposition parties from presidential vote,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela s pro-government legislative superbody ruled on Wednesday that parties who boycotted this month s local elections had lost legitimacy, potentially eliminating the main opposition groups from the 2018 presidential race. The decree by the Constituent Assembly - created in a controversial July vote boycotted by the opposition and widely condemned abroad - infuriated Venezuela s opposition and drew criticism from the United States.   The Venezuelan government and its illegitimate Constituent Assembly are inventing rules as they go along. This is not democracy,  the U.S. Embassy said on Twitter. The Justice First, Democratic Action and Popular Will parties did not run candidates in this month s mayoral polls in protest against what they said was a biased election system designed to perpetuate leftist President Nicolas Maduro s  dictatorship.  Maduro had warned that could cost them participation in future votes and the Constituent Assembly echoed that position on Wednesday, saying the parties had lost their legal status and should re-apply to the National Election Board. Given that the board is pro-Maduro and authorities are constantly throwing up obstacles to the opposition, that could well mean those parties are now effectively unable to run in the presidential election due before the end of 2018. Maduro, 55, is expected to run for re-election despite the disastrous state of the economy in Venezuela, where millions are skipping meals and struggling to survive amid one of the world s highest inflation rates and widespread shortages of basics. Two of his potentially biggest rivals already cannot run against him: Popular Will leader Leopoldo Lopez is under house arrest, while Justice First leader Henrique Capriles is prohibited from holding political office.  We alert the world and all democratic governments that banning opposition political parties is yet another measure by the dictatorship that deserves rejection and condemnation,  said Capriles  party colleague Tomas Guanipa. Maduro and his allies say the Constituent Assembly has brought peace to the OPEC nation after months of opposition protests earlier this year in which more than 125 people were killed. Demonstrators said they were fighting for freedom, but the government condemned them as violent subversives.   It s time for the coupsters to face the constitution. Let no one undermine the people s participation and the democratic system,  Constituent Assembly head Delcy Rodriguez said after the passage of Wednesday s measure.

South Africa's new ANC leader Ramaphosa aims to fight corruption,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Cyril Ramaphosa, the new leader of South Africa s governing ANC party, said on Thursday he aims to stamp out corruption and pursue a policy of  radical economic transformation  that will speed up expropriation of land without compensation. Ramaphosa, a 65-year-old union leader who became a businessman and is now one of South Africa s richest people, is likely to become the country s next president after elections in 2019, because of his party s electoral dominance. His promise to fight rampant corruption and revitalize the economy has been hailed by foreign investors.  This conference has resolved that corruption must be fought with the same intensity and purpose that we fight poverty, unemployment and inequality,  Ramaphosa said in his maiden speech at the close of a five-day party meeting where he was elected.  We must also act fearlessly against alleged corruption and abuse of office within our ranks,  he said in the early hours of Thursday after a long delay. Ramaphosa, who is South Africa s deputy president, was elected the new leader of the African National Congress (ANC) on Monday, succeeding President Jacob Zuma as party head after Zuma s presidency became tainted with corruption allegations. Ramaphosa s narrow victory over former cabinet minister and African Union Commission chairwoman Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, 68, is seen as a pivotal moment for the ANC, which launched black-majority rule under Nelson Mandela s leadership 23 years ago but is now deeply divided with its image tarnished. Ramaphosa paid tribute to Zuma in his speech, saying the ANC would be  united  despite a fractious campaign. Zuma had backed his ex-wife Dlamini-Zuma for ANC s top job. However, investors are concerned that Ramaphosa may not be able to push through policy changes because the ANC s top decision-making group, known as the  Top Six , was split down the middle, with three politicians apiece drawn from Ramaphosa s camp and that of Dlamini-Zuma. Analysts warned that the division of the party presidency, held by Ramaphosa, and the state presidency in Zuma s hands, could lead to policy uncertainty or paralysis.  Mr. Zuma, for instance, still occupies South Africa s presidency   a cohabitation that may cause a period of policy uncertainty,  Capital Economics Africa economist John Ashbourne said  in a note.  Expectations that Ramaphosa would win the ANC race had pushed the rand to 12.5200 per dollar on Monday, its firmest since March 27, when a cabinet reshuffle by Zuma rocked markets and triggered credit ratings downgrades to  junk.  The rand weakened on Tuesday, but firmed on Wednesday as investors continued to digest how much clout Ramaphosa wields.  Victory for Ramaphosa, but not a loss for Zuma,  said Geoff Blount, managing director at BayHill Capital. Zuma has faced allegations of corruption since he became head of state in 2009, but has denied any wrongdoing. The president has also faced allegations that his friends the wealthy Gupta businessmen wielded undue influence over his government. Zuma and the Guptas have denied the accusations. Ramaphosa alluded to these allegations in his speech, saying,  At the state level we must confront the reality that critical institutions of our state have been targeted by individuals and families, through the exercise of influence and the manipulation of governance processes and public resources.  He said this had weakened the state-owned enterprises in Africa s most industrialized economy. South Africa, the continent s traditional powerhouse, has had lethargic growth over the last six years and the jobless rate stands near record levels. Ramaphosa also had a warning for corporate executives.  We must investigate without fear or favor the so-called  accounting irregularities  that cause turmoil in the markets and wipe billions off the investments of ordinary South Africans,  he said. South African furniture retailer Steinhoff, has been embroiled in a scandal over accounting irregularities, which have wiped more than $10 billion off its market value over the past two weeks. Ramaphosa also said he would aim to expedite job creation, improve the lackluster economy and speed up the transfer of land to black people. Two decades after the end of apartheid, the ANC is under pressure to redress racial disparities in land ownership where whites own most of the land.  This conference has resolved that the expropriation of land without compensation should be among the mechanisms available to government to give effect to land reform and redistribution,  Ramaphosa said. He said the land transfers would be speeded up under the radical economic transformation program, a vague ANC plan to tackle racial inequality. ",worldnews,"December 20, 2017 ",Real
Mexican governor requests leave to run for president,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The governor of Nuevo Leon, a prosperous state in northern Mexico, requested a leave of absence on Wednesday to run as an independent candidate for president next year.

"Explainer - Damian Green, UK PM's May deputy, resigns over pornography scandal","LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May forced her most senior minister, Damian Green, to resign on Wednesday after an internal investigation found he had made misleading comments about pornography on computers in his parliamentary office. Below are details about Green, the investigation into his behavior and May s decision to demand his resignation.  An ally and a friend from their days at the University of Oxford, Green was appointed first secretary of state, May s de-facto deputy, in the wake of her snap June election which stripped her party of its parliamentary majority.  In the tumultuous weeks after the June vote, Green helped to stabilize May s premiership and appease some of those within the Conservative Party who wanted her to quit.  His departure is a blow for the government as May navigates the final year of tortuous Brexit negotiations before Britain s exit from the European Union in March 2019. He is also the third minister to quit in recent weeks following the departure of the defense minister and the aid minister. The departure of Green, who like May voted in the 2016 referendum to stay in the EU, also removes one of her most senior advocates of a softer Brexit. The resignation comes a day after May started the delicate process of agreeing a common negotiating position among her cabinet for the long-term relationship Britain wants to have with the EU after Brexit. On Nov. 1 Kate Maltby, an academic, critic and family friend wrote an article in the Times newspaper alleging that Green had made an inappropriate sexual advance toward her in 2015.  He offered me career advice and in the same breath made it clear he was sexually interested,  said Maltby, who is three decades younger than Green.  He steered the conversation to the habitual nature of sexual affairs in parliament... He mentioned that his own wife was very understanding. I felt a fleeting hand against my knee.  Green denied the allegations as  absolutely and completely untrue . May asked the Cabinet Office, responsible for the administrative functions of the government, to investigate. Five days later the Sunday Times reported that the police had found pornography on a computer in Green s office during a 2008 investigation into government leaks.  Green said in a statement that the story was  completely untrue .  More importantly, the police have never suggested to me that improper material was found on my parliamentary computer,  he added.  In a second statement on Nov. 11 he again said no allegations about the presence of improper material on his parliamentary computers had ever been put to him.  On Wednesday, May s office published a summary of its investigation into Green.  It found that Green s conduct as a minister was generally  professional and proper  and that it was not possible to reach a definitive conclusion on the appropriateness of his behavior with Maltby.  It said however that the investigation found Maltby s account of the events to be plausible.  On the issue of pornography, it found the two statements made by Green on 4 and 11 November to be inaccurate and misleading.   The Metropolitan Police Service had previously informed him of the existence of this material,  it said.  These statements therefore fall short of the honesty requirement of the Seven Principles of Public Life and constitute breaches of the Ministerial Code. Mr Green accepts this.  On Wednesday, May asked for his resignation.  While I can understand the considerable distress caused to you by some of the allegations which have been made in recent weeks, I know that you share my commitment to maintaining the high standards which the public demands of Ministers of the Crown,  May wrote to Green in a letter.   It is therefore with deep regret, and enduring gratitude for the contribution you have made over many years, that I asked you to resign from the government and have accepted your resignation.  Green apologized for breaking the ministerial code.  He said that he did not download or view pornography on his parliamentary computers but accepted that he should have been more clear in his November statements about what the police had told him.  He said he did not recognize the description Maltby gave of their 2015 meeting but said he had clearly made her feel uncomfortable and apologized. He added that he deeply regretted the distress caused to Maltby after she wrote the article.   I regret that I ve been asked to resign from the government following breaches of the ministerial code, for which I apologise,  he said.  ",worldnews,"December 20, 2017 ",Real
Earthquake of magnitude 5.2 strikes near Iran's capital,"LONDON (Reuters) - An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 struck a town near the Iranian capital Tehran on Wednesday night, state media reported, but there were no initial reports of casualties or significant damage. Last month, a 7.3-magnitude earthquake hit villages and towns in Iran s western Kermanshah province along the mountainous border with Iraq, killing 620 people and injuring thousands of others. Authorities said they were gathering information about the latest quake, which hit in the late evening at a depth of 7 km (4 miles). They asked residents to remain calm but be prepared for possible aftershocks. The epicenter of the quake was 3 km from the city of Malard, and not far from Meshkin Dasht, which sits about 50 km west of Tehran, state news agency IRNA said. The quake was also felt in Alborz, Qazvin, Qom, Gilan and Markazi provinces, according to state media.   There have been no reports of casualties or damage,  Behnam Saeedi, a spokesman for Iran s National Disaster Management Organization, was quoted as saying by the semi-official ILNA news agency. In Tehran and other cities, residents flooded into streets and parks, fearing a stronger aftershock. Some set up tents to spend the night outside, and lit fires.  Tasnim news agency quoted Minister of Sports Masoud Soltanifar as saying sport centers in city of Karaj in Alborz province, and Eslamshahr in southern Tehran were open to the public to spend the night.  Some people also took refuge at the mausoleum of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic in southern Tehran. Minister of Energy Reza Ardakanian was quoted by ISNA news agency as saying that Amirkabir Dam, one hour west of Tehran, remained intact and supply of water and electricity was not disrupted in any way.

U.S. follows Mexico in backing disputed Honduran vote result,"WASHINGTON/TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday followed Mexico in signaling that Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez had won a heavily disputed presidential election last month, lending weight to his legitimacy in spite of ongoing opposition protests. The Honduran electoral tribunal at the weekend declared U.S. ally Hernandez the winner of the Nov. 26 election in spite of widespread misgivings about the count, which turned in favor of the incumbent after suddenly halting with the opposition ahead. Violent protests have broken out in Honduras over the vote, and the Organization of American States (OAS) urged the country to hold new elections to resolve the dispute. That proposal has, however, been rejected by senior Honduran officials. Hernandez s rival Salvador Nasralla traveled to Washington this week to urge the United States not to recognize the vote, but a senior U.S. State Department official said that his government had no evidence that would alter the results.  At this point ... we have not seen anything that alters the final result,  the official told reporters, saying Washington may wait to make a definitive judgment in case the opposition presents additional evidence of fraud in the election. Mexico on Tuesday congratulated Hernandez for being declared victor. Mexico s step, which followed the recognition of Hernandez by Colombia and Guatemala, strengthened the incumbent s hand and could tilt other countries in his favor.  The Mexican statement, and its review, indicates that a call for a new election is a pretty dramatic outcome in this case,  said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Washington may hold off on making a final judgment until the end of a five-day period when the opposition can produce further evidence to contest the results, the official added. He said a U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state met with Nasralla, who has accused Hernandez of stealing the election.  He did not have any new (allegations of) fraud (or) evidence to present to us, and I think we are going to work through this quickly to get to a definitive U.S. statement, he added.  The Mexican statement is going to have a strong influence on whether we think we can move forward sooner. The Mexicans seem pretty certain in their statement.  Hernandez on Wednesday named a new head of the armed forces, Rene Orlando Ponce, who quickly indicated on local radio that solving the impasse would be for Honduras alone.  We re not going to accept any interference beyond Honduran law,  he said. ",worldnews,"December 20, 2017 ",Real
May will allow Brexit delay in exceptional circumstances,"LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May said on Wednesday she would permit a delay to Britain s departure from the European Union in exceptional circumstances, bowing to criticism from her own party over the government s plan to fix the exit date in law. The decision is a compromise with Conservative lawmakers who last week rebelled in parliament and inflicted an embarrassing defeat on May during a debate on the legislation that will end Britain s EU membership. The legislation, formally titled the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill, later won approval to move to the next stage of the parliamentary process, although it still faces weeks of further scrutiny before becoming law. May headed off a second rebellion by agreeing that her government s plan to define the date of Britain s EU exit as March 29, 2019, should be tempered by inserting a proviso allowing that date to be changed if necessary.  If that power were to be used, it would be only in extremely exceptional circumstances and for the shortest possible time,  May told lawmakers. Parliament will have to approve any new date. Junior Brexit Minister Steve Baker added that he could not envisage the date being brought forward. The passage of the bill to the next stage was overshadowed by the resignation of May s most senior ally in government, Damian Green, at May s request after an internal investigation found he had breached the government s code of conduct. The destabilising resignation adds to the political difficulties May faces as she tries to deliver Brexit against a backdrop of a divided parliament and electorate, and questions about her ability to meet an already tight timetable.  She wants to negotiate a transition deal with Brussels by March to reassure businesses and then seal a long-term trade deal by October. Brussels has said a detailed trade deal is likely to take much longer, and that Britain s transition period must end by 2020. In addition, May s government has to undertake the huge legislative task of transferring the existing body of EU law into British law before it leaves in order to provide legal certainty for businesses.

"Factbox: May's Brexit plan passes parliamentary test, more to come","LONDON (Reuters) - Legislation underpinning the government s plan to leave the European Union passed the latest stage in its journey through parliament on Wednesday, but still faces weeks of scrutiny before it becomes law. After eight days of debate, the legislation completed its  Committee Stage , where lawmakers debate the bill line by line and try to make changes to the government s proposed wording. Formally known as the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill, the legislation will now face other stages of approval in the lower house of parliament, and must then make its way through a multi-stage process in the upper house.  Both chambers must agree on the wording before it can become law. What is the bill and what does it do? The legislation serves two main functions: 1. Repealing the 1972 European Communities Act which made Britain a member of the European Communities, forerunner to the European Union. This effectively ends Britain s EU membership. 2. Transferring the existing body of EU law into British law. This is designed to provide legal certainty about the complex process of leaving.  Why is it controversial? The bill has faced criticism from opposition lawmakers, campaign groups and members of May s Conservative Party. Brexit is still divisive in Britain after a referendum in June last year, and many people, including some lawmakers, want to retain as much of the country s current EU membership as possible. Others would like to reverse the vote altogether. The most significant objections so far have focused on several different parts of the bill: 1. The power for the government to amend EU laws as they are brought onto the British statute book.  2. The extent to which parliament will be given a say on the final exit deal. 3. The government s intention to fix March 29, 2019 in law as  Exit Day . May runs a minority government, which has a slim 13-seat working majority in the 650-seat parliament thanks to a deal with a small Northern Irish party. Only seven Conservative lawmakers could be required to rebel to defeat the government. What has happened so far? The threat of rebellion has forced the government to make several concessions on its plans, including Wednesday s compromise to allow the date of Brexit to be changed in exceptional circumstances. Ministers also agreed to greater scrutiny in parliament of the process of transposing EU law. May suffered one embarrassing defeat, when 11 Conservatives sided with the opposition to successfully demand stronger guarantees that parliament will have a meaningful vote on the country s final exit agreement. Ministers fought off, or bargained their way out of other disagreements on issues like the powers government will have to change EU laws as they are transposed into British law, and the government s intention not to transfer across the EU s Charter of Fundamental Rights. The bill cleared its first parliamentary hurdle in September when, after two days of debate, lawmakers voted 326 to 290 in favor of the principles of the bill.  What happens next? The debate will continue in the lower house of parliament next year at a date which has yet to be set. This so-called  Report Stage  is a new opportunity to add amendments. Immediately after report stage, the bill is given a  Third Reading . It usually lasts an hour and is a general discussion of the bill followed by a vote. No amendments can be made. If approved, the bill will then pass to the upper chamber of parliament, where the Conservatives do not have a majority. The entire process will take months to complete, and there is no target end date. House of Lords:  Once the bill passes to the unelected upper chamber of parliament, the House of Lords, Lords can put forward their own amendments, each of which will be discussed and decided on in turn. If the lords agree to any amendments, the bill passes back to the House of Commons for its approval. Ping Pong: If the bill passes back to the commons, they debate and vote on the lords  amendments. No new amendments can be introduced. In theory the bill can continue passing back and forth between the lords and commons until the final bill is agreed upon. Royal assent: Once the bill has been agreed by both houses of parliament, it is given royal assent, when the queen formally agrees to make the bill into an Act of Parliament.

Full Brexit in Jan. 2021 as EU sets transition deadline,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union wants a transition period after Brexit to end no later than the last day of 2020, according to the European Commission s negotiating directives agreed on Wednesday. That date, coinciding with the end of the EU s seven-year budget period and 21 months after Britain departs the EU, had long been expected as the target end point of the transition. But this was the first official confirmation that it is the goal of the Union s negotiators. British Prime Minister Theresa May had sought a transition lasting around two years. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier, speaking at a news conference after the EU executive had agreed the terms, said the 2020 deadline was logical and would avoid complications in the next 2021-2027 EU budget period.  The four pages of new directives for Barnier were in line with guidelines issued by EU leaders at a summit on Friday and will form the basis of talks on the transition that he hopes to start next month. He has said in the past he hopes a free trade pact could be ready to take effect in January 2021. The directives spell out that Britain will effectively remain in EU institutions, bound by all their rules including new ones, while not having a say in their making.  The EU will also offer Britain a non-voting place at some meetings where decisions may affect specific issues and will set up special arrangements for a UK role in setting annual EU fishing quotas. The directives also spell out more clearly that EU treaties with other countries and international organizations will no longer apply to Britain during the transition period.  However, the document adds:  Where it is in the interest of the Union, the Union may consider whether and how arrangements can be agreed that would maintain the effects of the agreements as regards the United Kingdom during the transition period.      This has been important to Britain since it could mean that it no longer benefits automatically from free trade agreements which the EU has with, say, Canada or South Korea, while it would still have to apply EU trade policy   for example collecting EU customs duty at UK ports. Barnier said he understood that Britain was working with other countries to try to retain the advantages of some of the nearly 750 international agreements to which London is currently party as an EU member. Among elements spelled out more in the directives than in the leaders  guidelines last week was a repetition of a previously agreed EU position that everything applying to Brexit for Britain would also apply to other British territories. Brussels has said the Spanish government must agree any future arrangements with Britain that affect the British territory of Gibraltar on Spain s southern coast. Asked about his previously expressed view that a future trade deal may offer little automatic access for the City of London s financial services firms to the EU market, Barnier repeated that free access would be unprecedented as far as he was aware.  I remind you that I m not aware of any free-trade deal in the past between the European Union and third countries that would have allowed privileged access for financial services,  he told a news conference.  British negotiators have said Britain s size and proximity give it the leverage to negotiate a more ambitious relationship with the EU than any other state. During the transition, Britain will maintain access to the European single market, Barnier added.  Britain will keep all the benefits, but also all the obligations of the single market, the customs union and the common policies,  he said, ruling out  a la carte  terms. Barnier welcomed agreements made earlier this month on issues such as the Irish border, citizens  rights and the divorce settlement.  We are not at the end of the road,  he said.  But it is an important stage of this road towards an orderly withdrawal rather than a disorderly one.  ",worldnews,"December 20, 2017 ",Real
"U.S. sanctions Chechen leader, four others under Magnitsky Act","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department on Wednesday imposed new sanctions on five Russians and Chechens, including the head of the Russian republic of Chechnya, for alleged human rights abuses.  The new sanctions blacklisted Ramzan Kadyrov, the Chechen leader and a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Treasury Department said in a statement.  U.S. authorities accused Kadyrov of overseeing  an administration involved in disappearances and extrajudicial killings . On a conference call with reporters Wednesday, a senior U.S. State Department official said that  one or more of Kadyrov s political opponents were killed at his direction.   Kadyrov reacted to news of the sanctions with his usual defiance.  A sleepless night is waiting for me,  Kadyrov wrote, apparently sarcastically, on his Instagram social media account.  I can be proud that I m out of favor with the special services of the USA. In fact, the USA cannot forgive me for dedicating my whole life to the fight against foreign terrorists among which there are bastards of America s special services.  He also wrote that he would not be visiting the United States. The U.S. Treasury Department imposed the sanctions, which freeze the banks accounts of those targeted, under a 2012 law known as the Magnitsky Act.  The Magnitsky Act imposed visa bans and asset freezes on Russian officials linked to the death in prison of Sergei Magnitsky, a 37-year-old Russian auditor and whistleblower. The act also seeks to hold responsible those U.S. authorities allege orchestrated or benefited from the death of Magnitsky.   Treasury remains committed to holding accountable those involved in the Sergei Magnitsky affair, including those with a role in the criminal conspiracy and fraud scheme that he uncovered,  Director of the Treasury Department s Office of Foreign Assets Control John Smith said in a statement. Magnitsky was arrested and died in a Moscow jail in 2009 after discovering a $230 million tax fraud scheme, according to U.S. authorities. Supporters of Magnitsky say the Russian state murdered him by denying him adequate medical care after he was imprisoned on tax evasion charges. The Kremlin denies the allegation. In addition to Kadyrov and one other Chechen official, the Treasury s action on Wednesday targeted three Russians that U.S. authorities say were involved in the complex tax fraud scheme that Magnitsky exposed. The Magnitsky sanctions have been a point of tension between Moscow and Washington, even before Russia s annexation of Crimea sent relations spiraling. In retaliation for the Magnitsky Act, Putin signed a bill halting U.S. adoptions of Russian children. It had been unclear to sanctions experts whether President Donald Trump s administration, which has signaled a desire to rebuild ties with Moscow, would continue to target people under the law.  The Magnitsky Act attracted greater public attention when it emerged that the president s son Donald Trump Jr., had met with a Russian lawyer and a lobbyist - both strident opponents of the law - in New York ahead of the 2016 U.S. elections. When asked about the June 2016 meeting, Trump Jr. later said they discussed the adoptions issue. On a conference call with reporters on Wednesday, State Department officials said that despite the new sanctions the Trump administration wants a constructive relationship with Moscow.  We believe a Russia that takes care of the human rights of its own citizens will be an even more effective partner,  a senior State Department official said. ",worldnews,"December 20, 2017 ",Real
Turkish PM calls Rohingya killings in Myanmar 'genocide',"COX S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Turkey s prime minister on Wednesday dubbed the killing of minority Muslim Rohingyas in Myanmar by its security forces  genocide  and urged the international community to ensure their safety back home. Binali Yildirim met several Rohingyas in two refugee camps in Cox s Bazar in neighboring Bangladesh. Almost 870,000 Rohingya fled there, about 660,000 of whom arrived after Aug. 25, when Rohingya militants attacked security posts and the Myanmar army launched a counter-offensive.  The Myanmar military has been trying to uproot Rohingya Muslim community from their homeland and for that they persecuted them, set fire to their homes, villages, raped and abused women and killed them,  Yildirim told reporters from Cox s Bazar, before flying back to Turkey.  It s one kind of a genocide,  he said.  The international community should also work together to ensure their safe and dignified return to their homeland,  Yildirim, who was accompanied by Bangladesh s Foreign Minister Abul Hassan Mahmood Ali, said. Surveys of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh by aid agency Medecins Sans Frontieres have shown at least 6,700 Rohingya were killed in Rakhine state in the month after violence flared up on Aug. 25, MSF said last week. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra ad al-Hussein has called the violence  a textbook example of ethnic cleansing  and said he would not be surprised if a court eventually ruled that genocide had taken place. Yildirim inaugurated a medical camp at Balukhali, sponsored by Turkey, and handed over two ambulances to Cox s Bazar district administration. He also distributed food to Rohingya refugees at Kutupalong makeshift camp. He urged the international community to enhance support for Rohingyas in Bangladesh and help find a political solution to this humanitarian crisis. U.N. investigators have heard Rohingya testimony of a  consistent, methodical pattern of killings, torture, rape and arson . The United Nations defines genocide as acts meant to destroy a national, ethnic, racial or religious group in whole or in part. Such a designation is rare under international law, but has been used in contexts including Bosnia, Sudan and an Islamic State campaign against the Yazidi communities in Iraq and Syria. Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi s less than two-year old civilian government has faced heavy international criticism for its response to the crisis, though it has no control over the generals it has to share power with under Myanmar s transition after decades of military rule. Yildirim s trip follows Turkish first lady Emine Erdogan s visit in September to the Rohingya camp, when she said the crack down in Myanmar s Rakhine state was  tantamount to genocide  and a solution to the Rohingya crisis lies in Myanmar alone.

Trump threatens to cut aid to U.N. members over Jerusalem vote,"WASHINGTON/UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday threatened to cut off financial aid to countries that vote in favor of a draft United Nations resolution calling for the United States to withdraw its decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital.  They take hundreds of millions of dollars and even billions of dollars, and then they vote against us. Well, we re watching those votes. Let them vote against us. We ll save a lot. We don t care,  Trump told reporters at the White House. The 193-member U.N. General Assembly will hold a rare emergency special session on Thursday - at the request of Arab and Muslim countries - to vote on a draft resolution, which the United States vetoed on Monday in the 15-member U.N. Security Council. The remaining 14 Security Council members voted in favor of the Egyptian-drafted resolution, which did not specifically mention the United States or Trump but which expressed  deep regret at recent decisions concerning the status of Jerusalem.  U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley, in a letter to dozens of U.N. states on Tuesday seen by Reuters, warned that Trump had asked her to  report back on those countries who voted against us.  She bluntly echoed that call in a Twitter post:  The U.S. will be taking names.   Several senior diplomats said Haley s warning was unlikely to change many votes in the General Assembly, where such direct, public threats are rare. Some diplomats brushed off the warning as more likely aimed at impressing U.S. voters.  According to figures from the U.S. government s aid agency USAID, in 2016 the United States provided some $13 billion in economic and military assistance to countries in sub-Saharan Africa and $1.6 billion to states in East Asia and Oceania. It provided some $13 billion to countries in the Middle East and North Africa, $6.7 billion to countries in South and Central Asia, $1.5 billion to states in Europe and Eurasia and $2.2 billion to Western Hemisphere countries, according to USAID.  Miroslav Lajcak, president of the General Assembly, declined to comment on Trump s remarks, but added:  It s the right and responsibility of member states to express their views.  A spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also declined to comment on Trump s remarks on Wednesday.    I like the message that Nikki sent yesterday at the United Nations, for all those nations that take our money and then they vote against us at the Security Council, or they vote against us potentially at the assembly,  Trump said. Trump abruptly reversed decades of U.S. policy this month when he recognized Jerusalem as Israel s capital, generating outrage from Palestinians and the Arab world and concern among Washington s Western allies. He also plans to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. The draft U.N. resolution calls on all countries to refrain from establishing diplomatic missions in Jerusalem.  A senior diplomat from a Muslim country, speaking on condition of anonymity, said of Haley s letter:  States resort to such blatant bullying only when they know they do not have a moral or legal argument to convince others.   Responding directly to that comment on Twitter, Haley said:  Actually it is when a country is tired of being taken for granted.  A senior Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, described Haley s letter as  poor tactics  at the United Nations  but pretty good for Haley 2020 or Haley 2024,  referring to speculation that Haley might run for higher office.   She s not going to win any votes in the General Assembly or the Security Council, but she is going to win some votes in the U.S. population,  the Western diplomat said.  A senior European diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, agreed Haley was unlikely to sway many U.N. states.   We are missing some leadership here from the U.S. and this type of letter is definitely not helping to establish U.S. leadership in the Middle East peace process,  the diplomat said. Israel considers Jerusalem its eternal and indivisible capital and wants all embassies based there. Palestinians want the capital of an independent Palestinian state to be in the city s eastern sector, which Israel captured in a 1967 war and annexed in a move never recognized internationally.  The first name that she should write down is Bolivia,  Bolivia s U.N. Ambassador Sacha Sergio Llorentty Sol z said of Haley s message.  We regret the arrogance and disrespect to the sovereign decision of member states and to multilateralism.  ",worldnews,"December 20, 2017 ",Real
Arab coalition says will keep Yemen port open; air raids kill at least nine,"ADEN (Reuters) - The Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen said on Wednesday it would keep the Houthi-controlled Hodeidah port, vital for aid, open for a month despite a fresh missile attack against Riyadh, but it kept up air raids that killed at least nine people. The Western-backed coalition, which controls Yemen s airspace and port access, said last month it would allow humanitarian relief through Hodeidah following a nearly three-week blockade imposed because of a missile attack toward the Saudi capital s international airport. The Saudis say the Red Sea port, which is Yemen s main entry point for food and humanitarian supplies, is also a hub used by the Houthis to bring in weapons, which it accuses Iran of supplying. Tehran denies the charges. On Wednesday, the coalition confirmed it would keep access open to the port despite another missile attack at Riyadh on Tuesday by the Houthis which Saudi forces also intercepted.   Keen to maintain humanitarian aid to the brotherly Yemeni people and as a result of intensified inspection measures, the coalition command announces that Hodeidah port will remain open for humanitarian and relief supplies,  the coalition said in a statement carried by Saudi state news agency SPA on Wednesday. The Saudi ambassador to Sanaa said the coalition would also allow the provision of four cranes to the port to boost aid deliveries to the war-damaged country. The ambassador, Mohammed al-Jaber, who was speaking in a televised news conference, did not give details on how the cranes would be delivered.  Earlier this year, the United Nations said the coalition turned back four cranes the United States donated to the World Food Programme to boost aid operations at Hodeidah.  The cranes would have replaced parts of the port s infrastructure destroyed by coalition air strikes in August 2015, damage that forced ships to line up offshore because they could not be unloaded. The coalition said ships bringing in fuel and food would also be allowed to enter for another 30 days while proposals made by the United Nations envoy to Yemen were implemented, it added. The agency did not elaborate on the proposals. But the coalition has been demanding that a U.N. inspection regime agreed in 2015 be further tightened to prevent weapons from reaching the Houthis. SALMAN-TRUMP CALL Saudi state news agency SPA said King Salman discussed in a telephone call with U.S. President Donald Trump ways  to hold the Iranian regime accountable for its hostile acts and its involvement in supplying the Houthi militia with missiles to threaten the security of the kingdom and the region . The White House later confirmed the call and said the two leaders  agreed on the importance of reinvigorating a political process to end the war in Yemen  and that the king briefed Trump on a Saudi plan  to alleviate the humanitarian crisis  caused by the conflict. Tuesday s missile attack took place as the Houthis marked 1,000 days since the coalition intervened in the Yemen war in March 2015 to try to restore President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi after a Houthi advance on his base in Aden forced him to flee. Saudi Arabia said that since the war began the Houthis had fired 83 ballistic missiles toward the kingdom. More than 10,000 people have been killed and a humanitarian crisis unleashed in a conflict which has intensified since former President Ali Abdullah Saleh was killed on Dec. 4. Coalition forces, which are supported by the United States and Britain, meanwhile launched fresh air strikes overnight.  Residents said at least nine members of the same family, including at least five children, were killed in one air strike which hit their home in Wadi Khair in southern Yemen s Shabwa province. Coalition aircraft have been providing air support for southern fighters and pro-government troops as part of a push to clear the Houthis from Shabwa and the family were killed in an apparently mistaken attack. Residents also reported that coalition aircraft bombed a new parliament chamber, part of a government compound being built in Sanaa, causing damage but no casualties. The coalition had no immediate comment on the report but says it does not target civilians. Similar air strikes in which civilian homes, markets and hospitals were hit are recurrent in Yemen. On Monday, eight women and two children from the same family died when war planes struck a vehicle returning from a wedding party in Marib, east of Sanaa. ",worldnews,"December 20, 2017 ",Real

"South Africa's ANC calls for nationalizing central bank, land expropriation","JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa s ruling African National Congress has adopted a resolution calling for the nationalization of the central bank and land expropriation without compensation, a senior party official said on Wednesday. Any mention of nationalization in South Africa is enough to spook investors, since left-wing elements of the ANC have also called for mines and banks to be state-owned. Similarly, land is an emotive issue two decades after the end of apartheid, and the ANC has been under pressure to redress racial disparities in land ownership. Unlike most central banks in the world, the South African Reserve Bank has been privately owned since it was established in 1921. But its shareholders have no control over monetary policy, financial stability policy or banking regulation. Following a meeting of party delegates, the head of the ANC s economic transformation committee, Enoch Godongwana, told reporters changing the ownership of the South African Reserve Bank would not affect its independence. He said the party had also agreed to initiate amendments to the constitution to achieve land expropriation without compensation, but gave no timeline. He said there would be no illegal occupation of land. Following the proposal made in July by the ANC at a policy conference to nationalize the bank s shareholding, South Africa s Reserve Bank said that changing its shareholding would not affect its mandate, because that mandate is derived from the constitution. Godongwana said no timeline had been laid down for the plan to acquire the central bank s shares or for any directives to parliament to change the country s laws to effect the change.  No change in the constitution, no change in the Reserve Bank Act,  he said.  We ve also said it s not likely to have an impact at all because shareholders in the Reserve Bank do not affect monetary policy in any way.   Godongwana said the changes would come after  more work  was done to prepare for the bank s nationalization. In July, when the party said it would like the central bank to be wholly state-owned, investors were initially worried and knocked the rand.  The currency was little changed on Wednesday immediately after the announcement by Godongwana, but analysts said markets would react negatively.  The SARB resolution will spook the markets even if it is ultimately unlikely to be implemented,  said Anne Fruhauf political analyst with consultancy Teneo. On the land issue, Godongwana said some of the delegates became  rowdy  during the heated debate that  nearly collapsed the conference . ANC officials rejected reports that delegates had come to blows during the debate. Godongwana said the delegates eventually agreed to initiate some amendments to the constitution in order to achieve expropriation of land without compensation.  The condition is that it must be sustainable and not impact on food  production and food security,  he said, adding that there should be no illegal occupation of land. Asked how the markets would react, Godongwana said:  My suspicion is they are going to say  wow  and react badly ... my sense is, if I was the markets, I would simply hold off.  Most of South Africa s land remains in white hands 23 years after the end of white minority rule. Experts say the plan to expropriate land in South Africa will not signal the kind of often violent land grabs that took place in neighboring Zimbabwe, where white-owned farms were seized by the government for redistribution to landless blacks. However, some economists and farming groups have said the reform could hit investment and production. Around 8 million hectares (20 million acres) of land have been transferred to black owners since apartheid ended, equal to 8 to 10 percent of the land in white hands in 1994, the government says. The total is only a third of a 30 percent  target by 2014 set by the ANC. ",worldnews,"December 20, 2017 ",Real
Congo and Uganda to launch joint operation against rebel ADF,"GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - Congo and Uganda are planning a joint military operation against a Congo-based Ugandan rebel group blamed for an attack that killed 15 United Nations peacekeepers, army officials from the two countries said on Wednesday. Fighters from the Allied Democratic Forces are suspected of being behind the Dec. 8 assault on a base manned by Tanzanian U.N. troops in the Democratic Republic of Congo s troubled eastern borderlands.  The attack, which also killed five Congolese soldiers and wounded another 53 peacekeepers, and came amid a rising wave of violence in the mineral-rich area.  The commanders of the ADF are Ugandan citizens. A mechanism will be outlined so the two armies can share intelligence and carry out a coordinated operation,  said General Marcel Mbangu Mashita, a senior Congolese army commander in the east. Representatives from the two armies met in the Congolese border town of Kasindi last week. Under the plan, Ugandan troops will not cross over into Congolese territory but instead be concentrated along the border.  (The Ugandan army) is reinforcing security on the common border with Congo in order to dissuade any attempt by the ADF to cross over and attack targets of interest in Uganda,  Ugandan army spokesman Brigadier Richard Karemire said. Congo s U.N. peacekeeping mission, MONUSCO, has pledged to track down those responsible for the attack on its base. But it was not involved in the bilateral talks between the Congolese and Ugandan officials. Rival militia groups control parts of eastern Congo, long after the official end of a 1998-2003 war in which millions of people died, mostly from hunger and disease.  Congo and Uganda were enemies during that conflict and, in the years since, relations between the two countries have at times been strained. Increased militia violence this year in the center and east comes as Congo faces a political crisis linked to President Joseph Kabila s refusal to step down when his mandate expired last December. The ADF is an Islamist group that has long been active along the border and has been blamed for a wave of massacres there over the past two years. Since its leader Jamil Mukulu was arrested in 2015, it has been headed by Musa Baluku.  General Mashita said previous Congolese operations had succeeded in eliminating around a third of the ADF s top commanders, but added that its ranks had been bolstered by escaped prisoners after a major prison break in June.

Ugandan parliament passes law allowing Museveni to seek re-election,"KAMPALA (Reuters) - Ugandan legislators voted late on Wednesday to amend the country s constitution to allow 73-year-old leader Yoweri Museveni to extend his rule, potentially guaranteeing him a life-time presidency.  A provision in the current constitution limits the age of a presidential candidate at 75 years, which would have made Museveni ineligible to stand at the next polls in 2021. At the end of Wednesday s day-long House debate, which capped a protracted and violence-marred process to remove that age limit, MPs voted 315-62 in favor of the amendment.   The bill passes,  said speaker Rebecca Kadaga after announcing tally results, prompting raucous celebrations from the mostly ruling party MPs who favored the bill.  Earlier in the day, two lawmakers were dragged away and detained when they tried to enter parliament, as the divisive debate proceeded in the chamber. Police had blocked some legislators from entering the building, and live television footage showed two of them being driven away in security vehicles. Both opposed the bill. The legislators blocked by police were attempting to enter parliament to serve court documents on House speaker Rebecca Kadaga, who was presiding over the debate. The document called on her to appear in court at 2:00 PM in respect of  the irregular suspension of our members of parliament,  independent lawmaker Wilfred Niwagaba told a local television station minutes before he was detained.  Six MPs - all opposed to removal of the age cap - were suspended from parliamentary proceedings on Monday for alleged disorderly conduct and refusing to heed the speaker s instructions. The bill to amend the constitution was introduced in parliament on October 4 by a Museveni loyalist, after two consecutive days of brawling in the debating chamber between those opposed and those in favor, supported by security personnel.  On the second day, security personnel who some MPs said were soldiers from an elite military unit entered the chamber and violently ejected at least 25 MPs that the speaker had suspended from proceedings for alleged misconduct.  Wednesday s vote was the second time Ugandan parliament has changed the constitution to allow Museveni extend his rule. In 2005, they voted to remove a limit of two five-year terms, which blocked him from standing again. The bill also extended the length of a term for MPs to seven years from the current five. The limit of two terms was also re-imposed for the president, although that only means Museveni would be limited to two more terms, starting with the 2021 election.  Are you not seeing what happened in Zimbabwe, do we want his excellency to end like Gaddafi of Libya,  opposition legislator, Gilbert Olanya, who opposed to the amendment, said in Wednesday s debate as he attempted to persuade colleagues to reject it. Several African leaders have amended laws designed to limit their tenure. Such moves have fueled violence in countries including Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan. Initially hailed for restoring political order and fostering economic growth, Museveni has lately come under mounting pressure fueled by runaway corruption, and accusations he uses security forces to maintain his grip on power.  A combination of both military and police personnel were heavily deployed around parliament this week, which opposition MPs say was meant to intimidate members.

Canada's Trudeau broke ethics rules with visit to Aga Khan island,"OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau broke some conflict of interest rules when he accepted a vacation last year on the Aga Khan s private island, the ethics watchdog said on Wednesday, the first time a prime minister has been found to have committed such a transgression. While the finding could tarnish Trudeau s popularity half-way into his mandate, he does not face any penalties. Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner Mary Dawson said Trudeau contravened a rule on gifts when he accepted the use of the island in March and December 2016, while there were ongoing official dealings with the Aga Khan and the Aga Khan Foundation Canada was registered to lobby Trudeau s office.  The vacations accepted by Mr. Trudeau or his family could reasonably be seen to have been given to influence Mr. Trudeau in his capacity as Prime Minister,  Dawson said. While Trudeau says the Aga Khan is a family friend, Dawson found the exception for gifts from friends did not apply. Trudeau said he accepted her report and would clear future vacations with the watchdog.  I take full responsibility for it. We need to make sure that the office of the prime minister is without reproach,  Trudeau said.  Trudeau and his family vacationed on the island during the holidays in late December 2016 into January this year. Members of his family visited in March 2016. Trudeau has come under fire from the opposition, who have said the luxury Bahamas vacation was inappropriate and showed the Liberal government is out of touch with average Canadians. The opposition has also accused Finance Minister Bill Morneau of being in a conflict of interest for not putting his assets in a blind trust. He has since said he will do so and has divested his stock in his family business.  Trudeau says he has known the Aga Khan, Prince Shah Karim Al Husseini, since childhood. The Aga Khan, the title held by the leader of the Ismaili branch of Shi ite Islam, was a pallbearer at the funeral of Justin s father, former Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau. Trudeau also contravened the rules when he and his family traveled in the Aga Khan s private helicopter last December and when his family traveled on a non-commercial aircraft chartered by the Aga Khan in March 2016, Dawson said. However, she found no evidence Trudeau discussed any parliamentary business with the Aga Khan or his representatives, or participated in any related debates or votes.

Divided Catalans prepare to vote in close-run election,"VIC/CERDANYOLA DEL VALLES, Spain (Reuters) - Catalonia votes on Thursday for a new administration in an election many hope will resolve Spain s worst crisis in decades after the region declared independence leading Madrid to sack local leaders. Polls suggest neither the pro-independence nor the pro-unity camp will win a majority. The likely outcome is a hung parliament and many weeks of wrangling to form a new regional government. In the separatist heartland of rural Catalonia, fireman Josep Sales says he hopes the results will endorse the result of an Oct. 1 illegal referendum on independence from Spain and lead to the creation of a republic.  If we get a majority, something will have to be done. And if the politicians don t do it, the people will unite,  he said, speaking from the town fire station where many of the red fire engines bear the slogan  Hello Democracy .  If we have to bring the country to a standstill, so be it,  said the 45-year-old, who plans to vote for Carles Puigdemont, the sacked Catalan head who is campaigning for election from self-imposed exile in Belgium.  The uncertainty generated by the independence drive has hurt hotel occupancy rates in the region, dented consumer sales and caused more than 3,000 businesses to move their registered headquarters from Catalonia. It has also bitterly divided Catalan society between those who support independence and those who favor unity with Spain.

Six bodies hung from bridges near Mexico's Los Cabos tourist resort,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The bodies of six men were found hanging from three different bridges near the Mexican tourist resort of Los Cabos on the Baja California peninsula on Wednesday, local authorities said.  The authorities did not give details on what happened to the men, but drug gangs often hang the bodies of their murdered victims in public to intimidate rivals. Drug gang violence is set to make 2017 Mexico s deadliest year in modern history. Two bodies were found on a bridge in Las Veredas, near Los Cabos International Airport, and two on a different bridge on the highway between Cabo San Lucas and San Jose del Cabo, local prosecutors said in a statement.  In a separate statement, the prosecutors said two further bodies were found on a third bridge near the airport. An official from the prosecutor s office, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the bodies of the men had been hung from the bridges. Violent crime has spiked in Baja California, particularly around the once peaceful resort of Los Cabos visited by million of foreign tourists every year. Los Cabos police chief Juan Manuel Mayorga was shot dead last week.  Mexico is on track for its most violent year since records began, with the rise of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, now one of the country s most powerful, and disputes between other criminal groups fueling murder rates. On Tuesday, authorities in the northern state of Chihuahua said 12 people were killed in clashes between armed groups. The governor of the state of Baja California Sur, Carlos Mendoza Davis, said that authorities were investigating the incidents near Los Cabos.  I condemn these acts and any expression of violence. Today more than ever in #BCS we should be united,  he said via Twitter, using the hashtag for the state s initials. Homicides have more than doubled in Baja California Sur this year, with 409 people killed through October, from 192 in all of 2016. In June authorities said they had found a mass grave with the bodies of 11 men and three women near Los Cabos. More than 4.4 million passengers, mostly international, have passed through Los Cabos Airport so far this year, according to operator Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico.

Burst tire may have caused deadly tourist bus crash in Mexico -police,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The driver of a tour bus that crashed on Tuesday on a quiet road in Mexico s Yucatan Peninsula, killing 12 people, may have lost control after one of the front tires exploded, the local police chief said. The bus was carrying 31 passengers, including citizens of the United States, Brazil, Canada and Sweden, on a trip to Mayan ruins when it crashed and flipped over, authorities said. Most of those aboard were travelers on Royal Caribbean cruise ships.  It seems a front tire of the bus exploded, making it lose control and leave the asphalt,  Carlos Briceno Villagomez, head of the police in the municipality of Bacalar, told Mexican TV network Televisa on Tuesday night. The government of Quintana Roo state said it was investigating the cause of the accident, which happened on a flat stretch of road and did not appear to involve another vehicle. The driver was injured and has been arrested. A Mexican tour guide was among those killed.  A local civil protection official said authorities were also investigating whether human error contributed to the accident.   The U.S. State Department confirmed on Wednesday that multiple American citizens had died in the crash. Mexican authorities said eight U.S. citizens died.   We can confirm the deaths of multiple U.S. citizens in #Mexico bus accident, and several injuries. We express our heartfelt condolences to those affected by this tragedy,  State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a post on Twitter. One Canadian died in the crash and three others were injured, a spokesman for Canada s Global Affairs department said. Two Swedish citizens died and two others were injured, Mexican authorities said. A child was among the dead. Quintana Roo is one of three states on Mexico s Yucatan Peninsula, a major tourist destination. ",worldnews,"December 20, 2017 ",Real
"Exclusive: Cameroonian troops entered Nigeria without seeking authorization, sources in Nigeria say","ABUJA/DAKAR (Reuters) - Cameroonian troops this month crossed into Nigeria in pursuit of rebels without seeking authorization from Nigeria, causing a falling-out between the governments behind the scenes, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. At least one incursion was confirmed by a Nigerian government official, two Nigerian military officers and two foreign diplomats, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity. Nigerian security forces were deployed to the border to stop any further crossings, said a military source. The Cameroonian and Nigerian governments said in separate statements there were no incursions. Relations between the two countries are good, Cameroon said. Cameroonian military officials and pro-government media accuse Nigeria of sheltering Anglophone insurgents. For the past year they have been based in the dense equatorial forests that straddle the border between the two countries, fighting for an independent state they call Ambazonia. At least 7,000 people have fled as refugees from Anglophone Cameroon to Nigeria following a crackdown ordered this year by President Paul Biya to quell the insurgency, which represents the gravest challenge yet to his 35-year rule. French is the official language for most of Cameroon but two regions speak English and these border Nigeria, which is also Anglophone.  Cameroonian troops were in Nigeria,  said a foreign diplomat.  Zero warning, zero authorization.  The troops crossed into Nigeria at least twice this month, the diplomat and a Nigerian military official told Reuters. The incidents have caused anger on both sides and could sour diplomatic relations further as Cameroon increases pressure on its Anglophone regions, according to the diplomat and a Nigerian government official.  Tensions are high and could escalate,  the government official said. Cameroon government spokesman Issa Tchiroma Bakary denied that troops had crossed the border illegally.  Relations between the two countries are cohesive when it comes to fighting against terrorism. Cameroon and Nigeria are on the same wavelength.   Nigeria s foreign minister, speaking to Reuters after a cabinet meeting in Abuja, also denied the incursions.  The (Nigerian) government had investigated and discovered that it s not true,  said Geoffrey Onyeama, Nigeria s foreign minister. But the Nigerian government official and a diplomat said Cameroon had threatened to suspend senior Nigerian embassy officials in Yaounde after they lodged complaints. Tchiroma and Onyeama denied this. Governments in Africa often play down diplomatic disputes and present a show of harmony even during bitter rows. On Monday, rebels killed four gendarmes, Cameroon s government said, the latest raid on police and military positions in the country s southwest region. Nigeria has for decades been West Africa s powerhouse but  the militaries of the two countries have cooperated extensively to confront a threat posed by Islamist militant group Boko Haram. The group has staged attacks in Nigeria for years but more recently it has also conducted deadly assaults in Cameroon. Cameroon has repeatedly pressed Nigeria to allow it the right of hot pursuit for Boko Haram militants and the issue has left the countries at loggerheads. After Cameroon s military crossed the border this month in pursuit of separatist insurgents, Nigeria sent security forces to deter any future attempts, said one of the military sources.  We were not for war but keeping the peace and protecting our territorial integrity. They were asked to leave and they did and everything has been brought under control,  the source said.  Many refugees have crossed into Nigeria and many more are still crossing and the Cameroon authorities appear to be concerned that the situation may escalate if they keep coming into Nigeria.  Two Cameroonian military officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters separatists had set up bases and launched attacks from Nigeria. One attack was on Dec. 14 and involved two groups of at least 100 separatists, one of the officials said.  How do you explain that these guys come to attack us and then leave without being troubled across the border? When we drive them back, these separatists withdraw toward Nigeria,  the official said. Julius Ayuk Tabe, the Nigeria-based chairman of the Ambazonian Governing Council, the political wing of the armed resistance, said he was not aware of any separatist military bases in Nigeria. Cameroon s linguistic divide harks back to the end of World War One, when the German colony of Kamerun was carved up between allied French and British victors. The English-speaking regions joined the French-speaking Republic of Cameroon the year after its independence in 1960. French speakers have dominated the country s politics since.

German police arrest alleged Islamic State militant in ice rink truck attack plot,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German police arrested a 29-year-old man they said was an active member of Islamic State who was plotting a truck attack on an ice rink.  The arrest, a year after Anis Amri, a failed Tunisian asylum seeker with Islamist links, hijacked a truck and drove it into a Christmas market in Berlin, killing 12 people, comes as security services have warned of growing numbers of radical Islamists in Germany.  He was considering an attack on the ice rink on the Schlossplatz in Karlsruhe,  police in the south-western state of Baden-Wuerttemberg said, adding that the suspect was a German citizen whose name they gave only as Dasbar W.  To that end he was assessing areas around Karlsruhe Castle and, from September 2017, had begun seeking employment as a delivery driver - without success,  the police statement said. In 2015, the suspect traveled to Iraq to fight for Islamic State, receiving weapons training and working as a scout seeking potential attack targets in the city of Erbil, police said. He returned to Germany the following year. Before leaving for Iraq, Dasbar worked for Islamic State from Germany, producing propaganda videos and proselytizing to converts in online chat rooms, police said. Earlier this month, Germany s security service warned that the number of Salafists - followers of a radical Islamist ideology - had risen to an all-time high of 10,800, though the number prepared to mount attacks was in the order of hundreds.

Denmark no longer to automatically accept U.N. refugee resettlement quota,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Denmark will no longer automatically accept a quota of refugees under a U.N. resettlement program after passing a law on Wednesday that enables the government to determine how many can enter each year. Since 1989, Denmark has agreed to take 500 refugees a year selected by the United Nations under a program to ease the burden on countries that neighbor war zones.  But after the European migration crisis in 2015 brought almost 20,000 claims for asylum, Denmark has refused to take any U.N. quota refugees. Under the new law, the immigration minister will decide how many refugees will be allowed under the U.N. program, with 500 now the maximum except in an  exceptional situation .    It s hard to predict how many refugees and migrants will show up at the border to seek asylum, and we know it may be hard to integrate those who arrive here,  Immigration and Integration Minister Inger Stojberg said last month when her ministry proposed the law. The opposition Social-Liberal Party said opting out of the U.N. program would increase pressure on countries already accommodating large numbers of refugees, and the move could encourage other countries to follow suit. Last year, more than 6,000 people claimed asylum in Denmark. Between January and November this year just over 3,000 people did.

Philippine police chief defends deadly drug war of the 'Davao Boys',"MANILA (Reuters) - The police chief of the Philippines on Wednesday stood by the head of a secretive unit behind dozens of killings in the country s war on drugs, saying officers fired only in self-defence and the death toll reflected the danger and the scale of the narcotics problem. National police chief Ronald dela Rosa was responding to a Reuters Special Report that spent four months examining killings by one group of policemen from or near Davao City, the hometown of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. Dela Rosa said police district 6 in Quezon City had Metro Manila s most serious drug problem and he personally sent squad commander Lito Patay there because he was a  very professional  and  very dedicated  officer capable of dealing with it. Patay handpicked and headed a unit of 10 men who called themselves the  Davao Boys , which racked up the highest number of kills in Quezon City, a violent frontline in Duterte s ferocious anti-narcotics campaign.  Police station 6 officers killed 108 people in anti-drug operations from July 2016 through June 2017, the campaign s first year, accounting for 39 percent of Quezon City s body count, according to official crime reports analyzed by Reuters. A majority of the killings were carried out by the squad run by Patay, who was reassigned to Quezon City just a few weeks after Duterte unleashed his crackdown.  He (Patay) was chosen because I have big trust in him, he has the balls to face the problems. He will fight,  dela Rosa told reporters.  He is not an officer who is after money, who will be assigned in an area only to collect money, he is not that kind of officer. He has focus. I assigned him there because I know he can deliver.  Asked about the high rate of killings in areas under Patay, he said deaths were inevitable where the drugs trade was rampant.  So what s the problem? The worst drug problem is there in station 6, so if you hit the problem head on, you face the problem head on then, there would always result in casualties,  he said.     Nearly 4,000 mostly urban poor Filipinos have been killed in anti-drug operations since July 2016. Police reject activists  allegations they have executed drug users and peddlers and say they kill only when their lives are in danger. Dela Rosa said Patay has since been reassigned to another province to make him eligible for promotion, reflecting his success in convincing drug suspects in Quezon City to surrender to the authorities.  He said Patay had been  given a free hand  at station 6 and had command responsibility over his operations.   It is his own call whatever he does there, he has to solve the drug problem,  dela Rosa said. The story of the Davao Boys also highlights a larger dynamic: Many of the drug war s key police officers - dela Rosa included - hail from or served in Duterte s hometown, where the campaign s brutal methods originated during his time as mayor. Duterte has repeatedly denied he ordered the killings of criminals and drug dealers during his 22 years as Davao mayor, or his 17 months as president. Dela Rosa appeared frustrated when asked by a reporter if he personally had ordered the deaths of drug suspects in Quezon City. He said Patay s men had no alternative but to kill armed criminals who refused to go quietly.  He was placed there to address the drug problem, and not to kill those who deserved to be killed,  he said of Patay.  If they resist, why would you risk your life? You have to fight back.

U.N. freedom of speech expert concerned about net neutrality,"GENEVA (Reuters) - The U.N. s freedom of speech expert said on Wednesday he was concerned about the ramifications of a decision in the United States to roll back net neutrality, since it could lead to small and independent voices being drowned out on the web. Last week the U.S. Federal Communications Commission voted to repeal rules intended to ensure a free and open internet, setting up a court fight over a move that could recast the digital landscape. David Kaye, an American law professor and the U.N. Human Rights Council s independent expert on freedom of expression, said net neutrality, the idea that all internet traffic should be treated the same regardless of content, was essential.  Net neutrality is a really, really important principle from the perspective of ensuring broad access to information by all individuals,  Kaye told reporters in Geneva on the sidelines of the Internet Governance Forum.  I don t want to say that tomorrow there will be a huge amount of censorship, but over the long term, combine this with the concentration of media in the United States and in most places around the world, I think we should be worried about the ability of smaller voices that often (find it) harder to get traction in the market.       He said it would take years to know exactly what impact the U.S. move would have.  My concern in the U.S. space is that over time the companies will make decisions based more on their business model than on the content of information and the breadth of information that people should have access to,  he said.   That s a long-term problem and that s why I m very, very concerned about the rollback of net neutrality.  As companies blur the lines between providing the infrastructure and the content that makes up the internet, there is increasing risk of political pressure creeping in, Kaye said.   We used to think of telcos being very separate from content providers. But there s a lot of convergence now. So one of the risks is as content and infrastructure are merged more, the pressures on both, which might be of a political nature ... might restrict certain kinds of coverage.

Opposition groups quit Iraqi Kurdish government over protests,"BAGHDAD/ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - Opposition groups quit the government of Iraq s Kurdish region on Wednesday in protest at violent unrest in which at least three people were killed, with one group saying authorities had shown a flagrant disregard for life. In another test for the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in northern Iraq, the United States meanwhile called on authorities in the semi-autonomous region to respect press freedoms after it shut down a local broadcaster. The United Nations called for restraint on all sides. Tension has been high in the region since the central government in Baghdad imposed tough measures in response to an independence referendum on Sept. 25 called by the KRG in which Kurds voted overwhelmingly to secede. The move, in defiance of Baghdad, also alarmed neighbouring Turkey and Iran who have their own Kurdish minorities. Strains spilled onto the streets on Monday and Tuesday when Kurds joined protests against years of austerity and unpaid public sector salaries, with some burning down offices belonging to political parties. At least three people were killed and more than 80 wounded on Tuesday in clashes with Kurdish security forces in Sulaimaniya, local officials said. Some were injured when the crowd was shot at with rubber bullets and sprayed with tear gas. On Wednesday leading opposition movement Gorran withdrew its ministers from the KRG and Kurdistan Parliament Speaker Yousif Mohamed, a party member, resigned in response to the violence. Some have demanded the regional government s ousting.  We urge the international community to confront the flagrant disregard for life, liberty and democracy shown by the authorities in #Kurdistan Region,  Gorran said in a tweet. The Kurdistan Islamic Group (Komal), another opposition party with a smaller presence in parliament, also withdrew from the government. The U.S. embassy in Baghdad said on Wednesday it was worried about the closure of a local Kurdish broadcaster at the hands of Iraqi Kurdish security forces a day earlier.  We are concerned by recent actions to curb the operations of some media outlets through force or intimidation, specifically yesterday s raid by Kurdistan Regional Government security forces of the NRT offices in Sulaimaniya,  an embassy statement said. The United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) also  said Kurdish authorities should respect media freedoms and that it was  deeply concerned  about violence and clashes during the protests. It called for restraint on all sides.  The people have the right to partake in peaceful demonstrations, and the authorities have the responsibility of protecting their citizens, including peaceful protesters,  UNAMI said in a statement. Kurdish Asayish security forces on Tuesday raided the offices of Kurdish private broadcaster NRT in Sulaimaniya province, and took the channel off the air. NRT s founder and opposition figure Shaswar Abdulwahid was also arrested at the Sulaimaniya airport on Tuesday. His family have asked for his release, amid local media reports that another NRT journalist was arrested in Sulaimaniya on Wednesday. In a statement on Tuesday, Kurdish Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani, who is on an official visit to Germany, told protesters that although he understood their frustrations, the burning of political party offices is  not helpful .  There were no major protests in the city on Wednesday. Security forces from the region s capital Erbil have been deployed to help quell the unrest in Sulaimaniya, security sources told Reuters.  After Tuesday s unrest, curfews were imposed in several towns across the wider Sulaimaniya province, some have lasted through Wednesday. Local media reported smaller protests in towns across the province, including Ranya and Kifri.  ",worldnews,"December 20, 2017 ",Real
Austria's Kurz says will fight anti-Semitism after Israel voices concern,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said on Wednesday his new coalition would focus on fighting anti-Semitism, after Israel made it clear it would not work directly with any ministers from the far-right party now back in government. Kurz, a 31-year-old conservative, was sworn in with the rest of his government on Monday after reaching a coalition deal that handed control of much of Austria s security apparatus to the anti-Islam Freedom Party (FPO). The FPO came third in October s parliamentary election with 26 percent of the vote. Israel reacted to the inauguration by saying it would do business only with the  operational echelons  of government departments headed by an FPO minister. The FPO now controls the foreign, interior and defence ministries, though Foreign Minister Karin Kneissl is not officially a member of the party.  Anti-Semitism has no place in Austria or Europe. We will fight all forms of anti-Semitism with full determination, both those that still exist and those that have been newly imported,  said in a speech outlining the government s goals to parliament.  That will be one of our government s significant tasks.  The FPO, which was founded by former Nazis in the 1950s, says it has left its anti-Semitic past behind it, though it has still had to expel members each year for anti-Semitic or neo-Nazi comments.  It now openly courts Jewish voters, with limited success. Its leader, Heinz-Christian Strache, has also visited the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem.  Israel wishes to underline its total commitment to fighting anti-Semitism and commemorating the Holocaust,  the Israeli Foreign Ministry said in a short statement on Monday in response to the Austrian government s swearing in. The European Jewish Congress has called on the new government to take concrete steps against anti-Semitism while taking a generally more inclusive approach.   The Freedom Party cannot use the Jewish community as a fig leaf and must show tolerance and acceptance towards all communities and minorities,  it said on Monday. Austria, where Adolf Hitler was born, was annexed by Nazi Germany in March 1938. Next year will mark the 80th anniversary of that takeover as well as the 100th anniversary of the end of World War One, which led to the break-up of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Kurz said the events of 1938 were  shameful and sad . His People s Party (OVP) and the FPO published a 180-page coalition manifesto over the weekend, which includes plans to cut public spending, taxes and benefits for refugees. The OVP won October s election with a hard line on immigration that often overlapped with the FPO s. The issue dominated the campaign after Austria took in large numbers of asylum seekers during Europe s migration crisis, many of them from Muslim countries. Austria s Jewish community of just over 10,000 is tiny relative to the more than half a million Muslims who live in the nation of almost 9 million, many of whom are Turkish or of Turkish origin. Both Kurz and Strache have warned of Muslim  parallel societies  they say are emerging in Austria, despite there being few obvious signs of sectarian tension. Kurz flew to Brussels on Tuesday to dispel concerns that his alliance with the far right will undermine the European Union.  In their speeches to parliament, both he and Strache said they opposed Turkey joining the European Union   a position that polls show a majority of Austrians support.  Turkey is moving in the wrong direction, which means Turkey will certainly have no future in the European Union,  said Kurz, who has criticised Ankara s clampdown on dissent since a failed coup last year. On Tuesday night during his first foreign visit as chancellor, to Brussels, Kurz told broadcaster ORF he would  soon  meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  I hope we will succeed in dispelling the concerns that exist regarding the FPO government members,  Kurz said.  It would be in the interest of both our countries.

"Strikes kill 19 in rebel village in Syria's Idlib: Observatory, rescue service","BEIRUT (Reuters) - Air strikes killed 19 people in a village in Syria s rebel stronghold of Idlib overnight, a rescue service there and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Wednesday. The strikes pounded Maar Shureen in the northwestern Idlib province and injured 25 other people, the Britain-based Observatory said. The dead included seven children, it said. The war monitoring group added that Syrian government or Russian aircraft had struck the village. Russia s Defence Ministry denied involvement, saying in a statement carried by RIA news agency that its jets had not flown in that area.  There was no immediate comment from the Syrian military, which says it only targets militants.  Idlib s civil defense, a rescue service known as the White Helmets which operates in rebel territory, said on social media that fierce bombing killed 19 people overnight.  There were two consecutive strikes...The second strike came shortly before rescue teams arrived,  Mustafa Youssef, who heads the Idlib civil defense, said.  The Damascus government lost Idlib after insurgents took over the provincial capital in 2015. It has since become the only province fully under opposition control, and the most populated insurgent-held part of Syria.  Hayat Tahrir al Sham, the Islamist alliance spearheaded by the former al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria, is the dominant rebel force in Idlib. This has raised fears among some civilians and other rebel factions that the province could come under attack and turn into a major battlefield. Thousands of civilians and fighters have poured into Idlib in the past year, bussed out of towns and cities which Syrian troops seized with the help of Russia and Iran-backed militias. Government forces and their allies stepped up air strikes against opposition towns in the Hama countryside and the southern part of Idlib, rebels said last week.   The province, bordering Turkey, is part of Russian-brokered de-escalation agreements that seek to shore up ceasefires in parts of western Syria. Turkey, which had long backed some Syrian rebel factions, set up observation posts in Idlib in October under a deal with Russia and Iran to reduce fighting there.  Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has said the military operation in Idlib was largely completed. The deployment was also seen partly aimed at containing Kurdish influence nearby in northern Syria.

EU executive moves to punish Poland over court reforms,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The EU executive launched an unprecedented process on Wednesday to suspend Poland s voting rights in the European Union after two years of dispute over judicial reforms that Brussels says undermine Polish courts  independence. The European Commission, the guardian of EU law, will now ask the other EU governments to declare that Poland s changes to the judiciary constitute  a clear risk of a serious breach  of EU values   especially the rule of law. However, it gave Warsaw, where a new prime minister took office only this month, three months to remedy the situation and said it could rescind its decision if it did so. Often referred to as the EU s  nuclear option , the move carries the ultimate threat of sanctions but is in fact unlikely to result in that.  The Commission has today concluded that there is a clear risk of a serious breach of the rule of law in Poland,  the Commission said in a statement.  Judicial reforms in Poland mean that the country s judiciary is now under the political control of the ruling majority. In the absence of judicial independence, serious questions are raised about the effective application of EU law.  The Commission s deputy head, First Vice President Frans Timmermans, who has conducted talks with the Polish government dominated by Law and Justice Party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski for the past two years, said he was acting  with a heavy heart  but was obliged to take action to protect the Union as a whole.  We are open for dialogue 24/7,  Timmermans said, saying that if Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, who took office just this month, were to change tack, he would be ready to respond. But Timmermans insisted:  As guardians of the treaty, the Commission is under a strict responsibility to act ... If the application of the rule of law is left completely to the individual member states, then the whole of the EU will suffer.    This decision has no merit. It is in our opinion a purely political decision,  Beata Mazurek, a spokeswoman for Poland s ruling party, was quoted as saying by state news agency PAP. Stung by Britain s vote last year to leave the Union, the EU institutions are battling a rise in euroskeptic nationalism across the continent and particularly in the former Communist east, where Poland s ally Hungary has also prompted previously the Commission to threaten sanctions over the rule of law. Seeking to counter Warsaw s accusations of an anti-Polish bias in Brussels and in his own behavior, Timmermans, who once worked in the Soviet bloc as a Dutch diplomat, praised Poland s historic contribution to overcoming the Cold War divide of Europe but said Warsaw now bore a special responsibility to prevent new rifts opening up over democratic principles.  I want to stand by the Polish people in this time which is very difficult for them, and for us,  he said, adding that the defending a separation of powers was of  existential importance not just for the Polish nation but for the EU as a whole . The next step in the process is that EU governments, meeting in the Council of the European Union, will hear Poland out and ask it to address their concerns.  But if 22 out of the EU s 28 countries and the European Parliament are not satisfied in the end, the process will move on to the next stages, which may mean sanctions. The sanctions can involve the suspension of  the rights deriving from the application of the Treaties to the Member State in question, including the voting rights .  This formulation leaves open the possibility also of suspending EU financial transfers to Poland, now the biggest beneficiary of European funds aimed at boosting living standards in the former communist country. Sanctions can be imposed with the backing of a majority of countries representing a majority of the EU s citizens. But to get to that stage, EU governments have first to unanimously agree that what was initially just a risk of a serious breach of the rule of law has now become a reality. This is unlikely to happen, because Hungary has already declared that it would not support such a motion against Poland. But the mere threat of it underlines the sharp deterioration in ties between Warsaw and Brussels since the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party won power in late 2015. The Commission and Council of Europe legal experts, known as the Venice Commission, say Poland s judicial reforms undermine judges  independence because they give the ruling party control over the sacking and the appointments of judges, as well as the option to end the terms of some Supreme Court judges early. The Council of Europe, Europe s human rights watchdog, has compared such measures to those of the Soviet system. The PiS government rejects these accusations, saying the changes are needed because courts are slow, inefficient and steeped in a communist era-mentality.

Romania senate backs bill seen in West as threat to judiciary,"BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Romania s senate approved on Wednesday part of a judicial overhaul criticized by the European Commission, the United States and the country s own president as a threat to judicial independence. The bill passed by the assembly is one of three that have triggered street protests across the country, a European Union state ranked as one of the bloc s most corrupt, and drawn opposition from thousands of magistrates.  The three bills jointly limit magistrates  independence and set up a special unit to probe crimes committed by magistrates. This makes magistrates the only professional category with a prosecuting unit dedicated to investigating them. The proposed changes mean the country is joining its eastern European peers Hungary and Poland, where populist leaders are also trying to control the judiciary, in defying EU concerns over the rule of law. Lawmakers approved another bill on Tuesday, amending the definition of prosecutor s activity to exclude the word  independent . A third bill is widely expected to be approved on Thursday. The Commission launched an unprecedented action on Poland on Wednesday, calling on other member states to prepare to sanction Warsaw if it fails to reverse judicial reforms it says pose a threat to democracy. Romanian President Klaus Iohannis said there were  obvious risks  that the Commission could do the same in Romania s case if the legal changes take hold.  If someone imagines there will not be consequences, then they are from the moon,  Iohannis told reporters.  There will be consequences, the magnitude depends on the laws  final form.      It could be months before the bills are enforced. Opposition parties plan to challenge them in the Constitutional Court. The president could do the same, as well as send them back to parliament for re-examination, something he can do only once. He could also trigger a country-wide referendum on continuing the fight against corruption.  Romania s ruling Social Democrats, which command an overwhelming majority in parliament together with their junior coalition partner, ALDE, have so far ignored the warnings.  They are also working on changes to the criminal code that critics say will derail law and order. The country s prosecutor general, chief anti-corruption prosecutor and the head of the anti-organized crime unit have all criticized the proposed changes which they said will not only end the anti-graft fight but endanger general safety. Hundreds of magistrates protested in silence this week, lining the steps of courthouses across the country. Romania s anti-corruption prosecution unit has sent 72 members of parliament to trial since 2006. The speakers of parliament s lower house and senate are both currently on trial in separate cases.

"After U.S. veto, U.N. General Assembly to meet on Jerusalem status","UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The 193-member United Nations General Assembly will hold a rare emergency special session on Thursday at the request of Arab and Muslim states on U.S. President Donald Trump s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital, sparking a warning from Washington that it will  take names.  Palestinian U.N. envoy Riyad Mansour said the General Assembly would vote on a draft resolution calling for Trump s declaration to be withdrawn, which was vetoed by the United States in the 15-member U.N. Security Council on Monday. The remaining 14 Security Council members voted in favor of the Egyptian-drafted resolution, which did not specifically mention the United States or Trump but which expressed  deep regret at recent decisions concerning the status of Jerusalem.  Mansour said on Monday he hoped there would be  overwhelming support  in the General Assembly for the resolution. Such a vote is non-binding, but carries political weight. U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley, in a letter to dozens of U.N. states on Tuesday seen by Reuters, warned that the United States would remember those who voted for the resolution criticizing the U.S. decision.  The president will be watching this vote carefully and has requested I report back on those countries who voted against us. We will take note of each and every vote on this issue,  Haley wrote.  She echoed that call in a Twitter post: The U.S. will be taking names.  Under a 1950 resolution, an emergency special session can be called for the General Assembly to consider a matter  with a view to making appropriate recommendations to members for collective measures  if the Security Council fails to act. Only 10 such sessions have been convened, and the last time the General Assembly met in such a session was in 2009 on occupied East Jerusalem and Palestinian territories. Thursday s meeting will be a resumption of that session.  Trump abruptly reversed decades of U.S. policy this month when he recognized Jerusalem as Israel s capital, generating outrage from Palestinians and the Arab world and concern among Washington s Western allies. Trump also plans to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. The draft U.N. resolution calls on all countries to refrain from establishing diplomatic missions in Jerusalem.  Haley said on Monday that the resolution was vetoed in the Security Council in defense of U.S. sovereignty and the U.S. role in the Middle East peace process. She criticized it as an insult to Washington and an embarrassment to council members. Israel considers Jerusalem its eternal and indivisible capital and wants all embassies based there. Palestinians want the capital of an independent Palestinian state to be in the city s eastern sector, which Israel captured in a 1967 war and annexed in a move never recognized internationally.

Hamas says its security chief wounded in Gaza car bombing,"GAZA (Reuters) - Hamas  security chief in the Gaza Strip was wounded in a car bombing on Friday in what the Islamist group called a failed assassination attempt. The attack came as rival factions are trying to implement a new agreement meant to end a 10-year rift that has effectively split the Palestinian territories between Hamas in Gaza and the more mainstream Fatah in the occupied West Bank. Tawfeeq Abu Naeem, Hamas  head of security in Gaza and a strong supporter of the reconciliation deal, was lightly wounded when his car exploded outside a mosque, Hamas said in a statement. Hamas, which has been quick to blame Israel for similar attacks in the past, did not say who it believed was behind the bombing, suggesting it could also be the work of a radical jihadist Salafi group that opposes the Palestinian rapprochement. Asked about the explosion in Gaza, Israel s military said it did not comment on foreign reports. Hamas has stepped up a security campaign against Salafi groups and recently detained a senior operative. Hamas also has improved ties with Egypt, which is battling Islamist groups across the border in the Sinai peninsula. Some disputes arose this week in implementing the reconciliation deal. Senior Fatah officials traveled to Gaza this week from the West Bank to take control of two government offices there, but they turned back, saying Hamas officials refused their authority. A Fatah spokesman later said the issue was being resolved. ",worldnews,"October 27, 2017 ",Real

"Leave the past behind, Bulgarian PM tells Balkan leaders","SARAJEVO (Reuters) - Western Balkan countries aspiring to join the European Union should leave the past behind and solve their mutual problems first, Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov said on Friday. The EU won t do it for them, he said. Albania, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia are official candidates for EU membership while Bosnia and Kosovo are seeking the same status. But past rivalries are still hurting relations between some of the countries which were embroiled in the Balkan wars of the 1990s. Borissov said that Bulgaria, Austria and Romania, the three countries which will chair the EU presidency over the next two years, were ready to support the accession of these countries into the wealthy bloc but a key for the progress was compromise by their political elites.  Nobody can help unless we realize that the past needs to remain in the past and that we need to move forward,  Borissov said at a news conference during an official visit to Sarajevo.  Unresolved matters must be resolved today along with all political sacrifices that need to be made.   This cannot be solved by Europe, which has its problems and fears,  Borissov said.  The pace of Serbia s integration into the 27-member bloc was made conditional on the progress of a dialogue with its former province of Kosovo, which declared independence in 2008.  In Bosnia, inter-ethnic tensions have risen after Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats had revived aspirations for greater territorial autonomies within the country they share with Muslim Bosniaks, relying on their wartime allies Serbia and Croatia. Borissov said that  radical Islam is a problem  but that his Bosnian counterpart Denis Zvizic has assured him that Bosnia was not under the threat of radicalized Muslims.  Islam in Bosnia is certainly one of most tolerant forms of Islam practised in the world and any kind of radicalization has not and will not be allowed,  Zvizdic said at the same news conference. In September, the EU confirmed its pledge for a credible enlargement perspective for the region, which it sees as important for issues from controlling immigration to countering security threats ranging from alleged interference of Russia to radical Islam.

Zimbabwe's opposition leader Tsvangirai back in South African hospital,"HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai is back in a South African hospital for a medical review, nearly two weeks after he returned home from that country, his spokesman said on Friday, denying reports that he was critically ill. Tsvangirai, who suffered severe vomiting after a party meeting and was in September airlifted to a Johannesburg hospital where he spent nearly a month receiving treatment and recuperating. He returned to Zimbabwe on Oct. 13 but has not been seen in public since.  He came back knowing full well he would return for a review and he went for the review as scheduled,  Luke Tamborinyoka, Tsvangirai s spokesman said.  He could not say when he expected Tsvangirai back.     Tsvangirai s illness has divided the opposition, with some senior party officials saying the former trade unionist should consider stepping down to make way for a younger and fit leader. Tsvangirai, 65, declared last year that he was receiving treatment for colon cancer. Despite the illness, he is leading an opposition alliance to challenge 93-year-old President Robert Mugabe in elections next year. ",worldnews,"October 27, 2017 ",Real

Brexit drives Belgium to set up English-language commerce court,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Belgium will set up an English-language commercial court to deal with disputes between international companies to make the most of Britain s plan to leave the European Union. The Brussels International Business Court (BIBC) will seek to take on cases that are so far handled by British courts or international arbitration tribunals, the Belgian government said on Friday. Cases in Belgium s regular courts are heard in French or Dutch. The government said the demand for arbitration was likely to grow because of Brexit.  The same Brexit means moreover that going to a court in London might not be an appropriate option,  it said, without giving a date for the start of the English-language hearings. BIBC will be presided over by sector specialists and parties will have to agree in advance to let the court settle their differences. They will not be able to appeal against the decisions.  The development of the European Union cannot be slowed down by Brexit. Our country uses this opportunity to offer a new judicial instrument,  Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel said in a statement. Some companies, such as Lloyd s of London, the world s largest specialty insurance market, have already picked Brussels as their European base in order to retain access to the EU market after Britain leaves the bloc in 2019.

Hungary's Jobbik supports EU deepening with voters' blessing,"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary s main opposition Jobbik party could support deeper European integration, its chairman said on Friday, in a shift apparently aimed at bringing the far-right group closer to the political mainstream. Jobbik, which used to burn EU flags and was widely accused of racism and anti-Semitism, has tried over the past few years to convince voters it has become a more moderate conservative party that supports democratic institutions and civil rights. Chairman Gabor Vona told foreign journalists Jobbik does not want a two-speed EU, in which some member states would enjoy a lesser level of cooperation than others. Instead, it favored waiting until Europe s integration plans became clearer and then holding referendums across the EU to see which countries want to stay in. He also said Jobbik would be willing to join the euro zone as fast as economically sensible, which he called an economic issue, rather than a political one. Jobbik is a distant second behind the ruling Fidesz party in opinion polls ahead of elections due in April 2018, but it says poll results might be misleading with many voters hiding their preferences. Its policy proposals have often been echoed by Fidesz, which is also a right-wing party with strong anti-immigration views, but which has been seen as closer to the European conservative mainstream than more explicitly nationalist Jobbik. Vona said Europe was likely to transform in the next few years. Countries should wait for the bloc s trajectory to become clearer, and then all EU states should hold referendums on whether to remain members.  A referendum about membership would be legitimate but not now,  he said.  What would we vote about? The Juncker plan? The Merkel plan? The Macron plan? We have no idea what the EU means at this moment. We should clarify this together first.   Once we have that we should ask everywhere, not only in Hungary, whether people want whatever Brussels leaders cooked up or not.  Hungarians have warmed considerably to the EU in recent months. According to Eurobarometer, 56 percent of them now say EU membership is a  good thing , up 8 percentage points since March. That is the steepest rise in the EU. Vona said Hungary should join the euro currency as soon as possible, once public debt and competitiveness are appropriate. Ostracised in Brussels even by other far-right groups, Jobbik says it seeks to transcend traditional left-right political divisions and find new allies in the European Parliament after elections to the body in 2019.  We would be happy to see... a regional alliance of central European politicians who can look past left and right and embody common Eastern issues,  he said. ",worldnews,"October 27, 2017 ",Real
"Ahead of Trump trip, China urges U.S. not to allow Taiwan president in","BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) - China urged the United States on Friday not to allow Taiwan s president to travel through U.S. territory en route to the island s diplomatic allies in the Pacific, a sensitive visit shortly ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump s trip to Beijing.  China considers democratic Taiwan to be a wayward province ineligible for state-to-state relations and has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control.  China regularly calls Taiwan the most sensitive and important issue between it and the United States, and Beijing always complains to Washington about transit stops by Taiwanese presidents. President Tsai Ing-wen leaves on Saturday on a weeklong trip to three Pacific island allies - Tuvalu, the Solomon Islands and the Marshall Islands - via Honolulu and Guam. In a statement on Friday, a Taiwanese government spokesman said Tsai s trip was aimed at strengthening ties with friendly nations and also to provide support for the island s frontline diplomats. It said Taiwan was grateful to the United States for helping to arrange the stopovers  in accordance with comfort, safety, convenience and dignity principles.  Grace Choi, the State Department spokeswoman for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, said Tsai would transit Hawaii Oct. 27-29 and Guam Nov. 3-4. Choi said Tsai s transits would be  private and unofficial  and were based on long-standing U.S. practice consistent with  our unofficial relations with Taiwan.  She noted the transits were out of consideration for the safety and convenience of the traveler and there was  no change to the U.S. one-China policy.  Ambassador James Moriarty, chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan, the organization that carries out unofficial U.S. relations with Taiwan, will greet Tsai in Hawaii and Guam, Choi said. Trump is due to visit China in less than two weeks. He angered Beijing last December by taking a telephone call from Tsai shortly after he won the presidential election. China has made  stern representations  to the United States over the matter, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang, urging the United States to strictly abide by the  one China  policy.   China hopes the United States does not allow Tsai  to transit, not send any wrong signals to Taiwan independence forces and take real actions to protect the overall picture of China-U.S. relations and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait , Geng told a news briefing. The trip to the United States will be Tsai s second this year. In January she stopped over in Houston and San Francisco on her way to and from Latin America, visiting the headquarters of micro-messaging service Twitter Inc (TWTR.N), which is blocked in China, while in California. In Houston, she met Republican U.S. Senator Ted Cruz and Texas Governor Greg Abbott. She also spoke by telephone with U.S. Senator John McCain, head of the powerful Senate Committee on Armed Services.      China suspects Tsai wants to push for the formal independence of Taiwan, a red line for Beijing. Tsai says she wants to maintain peace with China but will defend Taiwan s democracy and security. China has pressured Taiwan since Tsai took office last year, suspending a regular dialogue mechanism and slowly peeling away its few remaining diplomatic allies. Just 20 countries now maintain formal ties with Taiwan, instead of China, mostly small states in Central America, the Caribbean and the Pacific. The United States has no formal ties with Taiwan but is bound by law to help it defend itself and is the island s main source of arms. Tsai s call with Trump was the first between U.S. and  Taiwan leaders since President Jimmy Carter switched diplomatic recognition to China from Taiwan in 1979. ",worldnews,"October 27, 2017 ",Real
Vietnam dissident's daughter calls on Melania Trump for help,"(Reuters) - The 10-year-old daughter of a jailed Vietnamese blogger,  Mother Mushroom , has appealed to U.S. First Lady Melania Trump to help win her mother s release ahead of President Donald Trump s visit to Vietnam next month. The handwritten letter, posted on Facebook on Thursday, drew attention to Vietnam s biggest crackdown on dissidents in years before the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in November. Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh, 37, known as  Me Nam  (Mother Mushroom), is one of Vietnam s most prominent activists. She was jailed for 10 years in June for publishing anti-state reports, including one about deaths in police custody. Her daughter Nguyen Bao Nguyen, nicknamed  Mushroom , referred to Trump s upcoming visit to Vietnam and the  International Women of Courage Award  awarded by the First Lady to Quynh in March, which drew an angry response from Hanoi.  Please help my family re-unite because I know my mother did nothing wrong,  Nguyen wrote in the letter, published on Quynh s mother s Facebook Page.  We love our mother so much and just want her to come back to us,  said Nguyen, who turns 11 on Saturday. Vietnam s government did not immediately respond to a request to comment.  The United States has advocated for Ms. Quynh s release, and the release of all prisoners of conscience, multiple times with high-level Vietnamese officials in the run-up to the President s visit to Vietnam   including in recent days and weeks,  U.S. Ambassador Ted Osius told Reuters.  Despite sweeping economic reform and increasing openness to social change, media censorship remains tight in Vietnam and criticism of the Communist state is not tolerated. At least 17 dissidents have been arrested this year in a crackdown that followed changes within the ruling party hierarchy and a growing number of environmental protests. Vietnam has carried out a simultaneous crackdown on corruption. Trump is set to attend the APEC forum in the seaside resort of Danang, besides making an official visit to Vietnam.  International donors and trade partners need to step up pressure on the country s leaders to improve its abysmal rights record, and the APEC summit is a good moment to start,  said Brad Adams, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. Quynh s mother, Nguyen Tuyet Lan, is now looking after Nguyen and her four-year-old brother  Bear . She told Reuters:  My daughter did nothing wrong; just consider what she did as constructive criticism for society.  ",worldnews,"October 27, 2017 ",Real
Czech election winner Babis warms to minority government,"PRAGUE (Reuters) - The anti-establishment ANO party that won the Czech parliamentary election may form a minority government if other parties remain opposed to forming a coalition, ANO chief Andrej Babis said on Friday. The ANO won 29.6 percent in last weekend s vote, nearly three times as much as the runner-up centre-right Civic Democrats, but fell short of a majority in parliament, a fractious chamber of nine parties. ANO s stance against immigration and corruption in mainstream parties, pledges to bring effective government and a centrist economic program drew voters away from parties that dominated Czech politics from the end of communism, echoing a swing to anti-system and anti-immigrant parties across Europe.  Babis has held talks with the eight other parties holding parliamentary seats but was spurned by all apart from the far-right, anti-European SPD, not his preferred coalition partner.  If we are rejected everywhere, we will try a minority government,  Babis, a billionaire businessman, told the www.idnes.cz website, part of a media group he owned until it was shifted to a trust fund this year.  And we will come with an agenda that partially meets the programs of all parties.  Babis has however also set more rounds of talks with all parties, and said he would wait to see how the situation develops after the new parliament first convenes on Nov. 20. ANO has 78 of the 200 seats in parliament. Most parties shun Babis because he faces charges of fraud. Police say he hid ownership of a farm and conference center near Prague in 2008 so it could qualify for a 2 million euro EU subsidy that was only meant for small business. He denies any wrongdoing and says the charges were politically motivated. Babis s Agrofert group, placed in a trust fund earlier this year, spans over 250 companies in chemicals, food, farming and media around central Europe including Germany. Forbes puts his net worth at $4 billion.    The mix of business, media and political power, plus his domineering style and wish to simplify parliamentary procedures, have prompted accusations that he is a threat to democracy. He denies this, saying he only wants to move the country forward. Pledges not to join a Babis-led cabinet were at the heart of most parties  pre-election agendas, making any turnaround tough despite positions similar to ANO on policies like infrastructure investment, tax cuts and greater government transparency. Babis again sought to dispel fears he would be anti-European fanned by his opposition to adopting the euro currency and deeper European integration, and the possibility his cabinet  could lean on eurosceptic votes from the SPD camp.    I see no reason why we should leave the European Union.  Europe is a project thanks to which we have peace, free movement of people, goods, capital and services,  he told Friday s daily Pravo. Babis added, however, that the EU needed to better protect its external borders against inward migration and draw lessons from Britain s decision to quit the EU largely over sovereignty and immigration issues.

Egypt kills 13 militants in raid on western desert farm,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Egyptian security forces killed 13 militants during a raid on a farm hideout in the western desert region on Friday, a week after a deadly attack on a police convoy, authorities said. An Interior Ministry statement gave no details on the militants, but Egyptian forces have been battling several armed Islamist groups, mostly focused on an entrenched Islamic State affiliate that has killed hundreds of police officers and troops in the northern Sinai Peninsula since 2013.  They took a house in the farm as a temporary hideout faraway from security monitoring to receive newly recruited elements and train them and prepare the explosive devices,  the ministry statement said. The clashes were in an area near the Assuit-Kharga desert highway, around 400 km (248.55 miles) southwest of Cairo, in New Valley province that shares a long border with neighboring southern Libya. Southern Libya has become a hideout for militant brigades taking advantage of the security vacuum there.  After clashes with the militants, the ministry said 13 bodies were recovered at the farm, some wearing militant uniforms. Security forces also recovered weapons, suicide bomb belts, cash and ammunition.    The statement did not say whether the group was linked to the militants who attacked police last week in a remote area of Giza governorate, 135 km outside Cairo, when sources say they were searching for a militant hideout.  Security forces dealt a severe blow to the terrorist elements in revenge for the blood of the men who were martyred last week in the oasis,  the state news agency MENA said earlier, citing a high-level security source. Most of Egypt s violence is centered in the northern Sinai, where a local group, Ansar Bait al-Maqdis, pledged allegiance to Islamic State in 2014. It had mostly targeted security forces with ambushes and suicide attacks, but has spread to other areas of Egypt outside the peninsula. The western desert region has long been for a route for smugglers and arms coming across Libya s porous border. The Egyptian military said on Monday its air force hit eight four-wheel-drive vehicles carrying arms and explosives at the western border with Libya, killing the militants on board.

Blast hits train in southwestern Pakistan; at least 6 hurt,"QUETTA, Pakistan (Reuters) - At least six people were wounded on Friday when a bomb went off along railway tracks in southwestern Pakistan, halting train service in the region, security and railways officials said.  The train was traveling from Baluchistan s capital of Quetta to the eastern metropolis of Lahore when a blast on the main railway track damaged one of its cars.  One train bogie was damaged in the blast and a portion of the tracks blown up,  said railways official Aammir Baloch, adding that Quetta s train services had been suspended. Security officials said six passengers were injured in the blast.  The Taliban, Sunni Islam militants and sectarian groups linked to al Qaeda and the Islamic State group also operate in the strategically important region, which borders Iran and Afghanistan. Baluchistan is at the center of infrastructure projects that form part of China s  Belt and Road  initiative, which has brought $57 billion of investment to Pakistan. Violence in the southwestern region has fueled concern about security for a transport and energy link planned to run from western China to Pakistan s southern deepwater port of Gwadar. Separatists in Baluchistan, who have long battled the state for a greater share of the resources of the gas- and mineral-rich region, also accuse the central government of discrimination. Separately, two workers of a prominent political party were killed on Friday in a landmine blast in the district of Harnai  near Quetta as they traveled to a party meeting.

"Myanmar gives green light to resume food aid to Rakhine, says U.N.","GENEVA (Reuters) - Myanmar authorities have agreed to allow the United Nations to resume distribution of food in northern Rakhine state which was suspended for two months, the World Food Programme (WFP) said on Friday. The agreement, whose details are still being worked out, came as UNICEF reported that Rohingya refugee children fleeing into Bangladesh were arriving  close to death  from malnutrition. The WFP was previously distributing food rations to 110,000 people in northern Rakhine state - to both Buddhist and the minority Muslim Rohingya communities. Rohingya insurgent attacks on police stations triggered an army crackdown, that the United Nations has called  ethnic cleansing , and U.N. humanitarian agencies have not been able to access northern Rakhine to deliver aid since then. WFP deliveries have continued to 140,000 people in central Rakhine.  WFP has been given the green light to resume food assistance operations in northern part of Rakhine. We are working with the government to coordinate the details,  WFP spokeswoman Bettina Luescher told journalists in Geneva. She had no timeline or details on the proposed distribution of rations to northern Rakhine, and said it was still being discussed with the authorities in Myanmar.  We just have to see what the situation on the ground is. It s very hard to say these things if you can t get in,  Luescher said. Some 604,000 Rohingya refugees have fled to Bangladesh in the past two months, bringing the total to 817,000, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said. Malnutrition rates in Maungdaw and Buthidaung townships in Rakhine, where the vast majority of the Rohingya refugees originate, were already above emergency threshold rates before the crisis, the U.N. Children s Fund (UNICEF) said.  Since August 25, we have had to stop treating 4,000 children with severe acute malnutrition in northern Rakhine because we have had no access,  UNICEF spokeswoman Marixie Mercado told the briefing. UNICEF has screened nearly 60,000 Rohingya refugee children arriving in Bangladesh, nearly 2,000 of whom have been identified as having severe acute malnutrition, with another 7,000 moderately acutely malnourished, she said. The agency screened 340 children among recent arrivals, a  rough and rapid exercise  that found 10 percent to be severely acutely malnourished, she said.   This is an extremely small number of children so these numbers are not representative,  Mercado said.  But what they do tell us is that some of the children are close to death by the time they make it across the border.  ",worldnews,"October 27, 2017 ",Real
"'Consistent' pattern of crimes against Myanmar's Rohingya, U.N. experts say","GENEVA (Reuters) - Rohingya refugees fleeing Myanmar have testified that a  consistent, methodical pattern  of killings, torture, rape and arson is taking place, United Nations human rights investigators said on Friday after a first mission to Bangladesh. The fact-finding team, led by former Indonesian attorney general Marzuki Darusman, said the death toll from the Myanmar army s crackdown following Rohingya insurgent attacks on Aug. 25 was unknown, but  may turn out to be extremely high .  We have heard many accounts from people from many different villages across northern Rakhine state. They point to a consistent, methodical pattern of actions resulting in gross human rights violations affecting hundreds of thousands of people,  Darusman said in a statement.  The team of three independent experts spent six days interviewing some of the 600,000 Rohingya from Myanmar s northern Rakhine state who are in refugee camps near Cox s Bazar. An advance team of U.N. rights officers have been conducting comprehensive interviews for weeks, it said.  We are deeply disturbed at the end of this visit,  Darusman said.  Radhika Coomaraswamy, another member and veteran U.N. human rights investigator, said she was left  shaken and angry  by the testimonies.  The accounts of sexual violence that I heard from victims are some of the most horrendous I have heard in my long experience in dealing with this issue in many crisis situations,  she said.  One could see the trauma in the eyes of the women I interviewed. When proven, this kind of abuse must never be allowed to go unpunished.   The U.N. team, which was established by the U.N. Human Rights Council in March, renewed its appeal for access to Rakhine state and for talks with the Myanmar government and military to  establish the facts .  The third member, Christopher Sidoti, said that Rohingyas must be allowed to return to Rakhine if they wish, but only after mechanisms are put in place to ensure their safety.   That may require the placement of international human rights monitors in Rakhine State,  he said.  ",worldnews,"October 27, 2017 ",Real
"After Iran shock, nervous Europe girds for next Trump salvo","BERLIN (Reuters) - Following Donald Trump s decision to decertify the Iran nuclear deal this month, shaken European capitals are asking themselves what the U.S. president will do next. Diplomats have sketched scenarios they fear could plunge transatlantic relations into crisis: a trade war, military conflict over North Korea, or the collapse of a Cold War-era arms treaty. They wonder if their post-war alliance can survive if any of them come true. Since Trump took office nine months ago, governments in Berlin, Paris and London have wavered between alarm at his rhetoric and a shaky sense that his worst instincts can be contained by the  grown ups  in his cabinet and pressure from allies. But the Iran decision, taken despite personal appeals from France s Emmanuel Macron, Germany s Angela Merkel and Britain s Theresa May, has changed the calculus in Europe, according to diplomats, politicians and analysts. No longer is there an underlying confidence that Europe can muddle through three more years of Trump without fear of major, and possibly lasting, disruptions to the relationship. Nor is there faith that Trump, when the stakes are high, will listen to what his advisers and partners tell him. The anxiety is especially acute in Germany, whose own identity is anchored in its relationship with the United States and whose reliance on Washington, particularly in defense and security matters, runs deeper than that of France or Britain.  There is a sense of desperation in Berlin, a sense that Trump does not know what is at stake, that he doesn t understand the historical factors that are at play here,  said Wolfgang Ischinger, a former German ambassador to Washington and chairman of the Munich Security Conference.  The transatlantic relationship is all about trust. In that sense, the Iran decision takes us to a new level. It is a breach of trust,  he said. Trump s decision to decertify the Iran deal will not necessarily kill it. That depends on Congress, which must now decide to impose new sanctions against Tehran. But the consensus in Europe is that a landmark diplomatic achievement has been seriously undermined.  Merkel alluded to the breakdown in trust back in May, when she said Europe might not be able to rely on the United States and must take its fate into its own hands. That came after a contentious G7 meeting in Sicily at which Trump ignored pleas from allies to stick with another multilateral agreement, the Paris climate accord. Since then Merkel, focused on an election and efforts to form a coalition, has said little about the transatlantic relationship or Trump. Macron meanwhile, has done his best to charm the American president, inviting him to Paris for Bastille Day celebrations and meeting him again at the United Nations last month.  I don t despair of making him change his mind,  Macron said in New York of Trump s stances on climate and Iran. In private however, European officials say they are worried that Trump s rejection of the Iran deal could be a harbinger of other disruptive salvos from Washington. One senior European diplomat said the next conflict would likely be over trade, describing Trump s attempt to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)   and his threats to abandon it   as a  litmus test . European firms, especially German carmakers who produce in Mexico and export to the United States, could be hit hard by a breakdown of NAFTA. There are also fears that Trump could carry out a threat to introduce steel import tariffs, which would hit European exporters as well as the Chinese.  So far there has been a lot of bark and no bite from Trump on trade, but that doesn t mean it will stay that way,  said the European diplomat.  We have to be prepared for real protectionist measures. Any steps that penalize European firms directly or indirectly would create a downward spiral.  ANTI-AMERICANISM North Korea is another area of concern. Thorsten Benner, director of the Global Public Policy Institute in Berlin, believes the reaction in Europe to a military conflict on the Korean peninsula could be  as messy as the Iraq war . The European public could view Washington as the aggressor in such a conflict. This could fuel anti-American sentiment, making it difficult for European leaders to stand with Trump and emboldening voices that are already calling for a break from Washington   no matter how unrealistic that looks in practice.  We have to wake up to the fact that we may be dealing with Trump for some time, and that there may not be a correction when he leaves,  one German diplomat told Reuters.  It hasn t dawned on people here that this is existential and you have to react.  Concerns about such sentiments led a group of a dozen Germany-based foreign policy experts to issue a manifesto this month, entitled  In Spite of It All, America , which warned Berlin against turning its back on Washington because of Trump. Former ambassador Ischinger shares that view. But he too is concerned the relationship could deteriorate further. One of his biggest fears is a collapse of the INF Treaty, a nuclear arms reduction pact signed by President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987. Washington and Moscow accuse each other of violating the treaty and Gorbachev himself warned this month that it was in peril. Should the INF unravel, Ischinger believes the divisive 1980s debate about deploying nuclear weapons in Europe could resurface with devastating consequences for transatlantic ties.  All hell could break loose, politically speaking,  he said. For generations of Germans, Ischinger says, the symbol of the transatlantic alliance has been U.S. presidents   from John F. Kennedy to Reagan, and from Bill Clinton to Barack Obama.  I can no longer tell my children that they are part of this alliance with Trump as president,  he said.  It is rather sad. I don t know how the loss of this symbol can be replaced.  ",worldnews,"October 27, 2017 ",Real
Indonesia questions fireworks factory owner after deadly blaze,"KOSAMBI, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesian police on Friday started questioning the owner of a fireworks factory destroyed in a series of explosions and a fire that killed 47 workers and injured dozens, leaving some with horrific burns covering up to 80 percent of their bodies. In one of Indonesia s worst industrial disasters, many workers were unable to escape the fire at the plant in Tangerang, an industrial and manufacturing hub near Jakarta, on Thursday. Police and residents broke holes in the walls to help trapped workers forced back by the intense heat from the blaze. On Friday, a pile of sacks was still smoldering as forensics experts searched for human remains. The disaster will throw a new focus on safety standards at workplaces in Indonesia, where rules are often poorly enforced.  Police said the owner of the fireworks company, PT Panca Buana Cahaya Sukses, had returned to Indonesia to be questioned, along with seven witnesses, mostly administrative staff at the factory.  When he heard about the incident at the factory he was in Malaysia and he flew back straight away and went straight to Tangerang Police,  Jakarta police spokesman Argo Juwono told Metro TV. Earlier, Tangerang police chief Harry Kurniawan told Reuters the cause of the fire was still being investigated and denied reports that the factory gates were locked.  Responding to a report that underage workers were employed at the plant, Kurniawan said investigations had not shown this to be the case. Hospital records seen by Reuters showed two of the injured were aged 15 and 16.  Tangerang General Hospital is treating 12 patients, some for burns over 40 percent to 80 percent of their bodies, said a spokesman, Yudi Firmansyah.    We are expecting treatment to take a long time,  Firmansyah added.  First there s the life-saving stage, then further treatment to prevent infections, and cosmetic procedures.  Ayani, who goes by one name, wept when she saw her severely burnt daughter, Nuhayati, 35, lying on a hospital bed.  Her skin has been burned off completely,  she said, pointing to her forearms, torso and legs, and adding that her daughter had started working at the plant a month ago.  She only had some hair on her head, but her skin is almost gone.  Officials have warned that the death toll could rise, with police saying three people were still unaccounted for. There were some narrow escapes at the factory, staffed mainly by young women paid about $3 a day. Fitri, 18, told Kompas media she survived by submerging herself in a large tub of water used to clean equipment, along with four workers.  If we stay here, we won t be safe,  she eventually told her friends, before climbing a 3-metre (10-ft) wall beside the tub and breaking through the roof. Then residents used a ladder to help her descend.The report said the fire was thought to have started in a holding area next to the front gate where fireworks were stored.         Victims in orange body bags were taken to a police hospital in East Jakarta for identification by families. Sugeng Priyanto, an official at the Ministry of Manpower, told Metro TV a team was investigating safety standards at the warehouse, which had been operating for a few months. Tangerang Regent Ahmed Zaki said the company had a permit to pack and wrap fireworks, though not produce them at the warehouse, which was close to a school and housing. Earlier he had said it had a manufacturing permit. The disaster illustrated the low safety awareness in Indonesia, Jakarta-based Concord Consulting said in a daily report.   Regulations may be in place officially, but too often are simply ignored, resulting in high levels of complacency,  it said.

"Exclusive: Energy, not tech or finance, in CEO line-up for Trump's China visit","BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. energy and commodities firms will make up a major part of a business delegation visiting Beijing at the same time as U.S. President Donald Trump goes to China in November, according to an initial list seen by Reuters. Prominent technology and financial companies are mostly absent from the list, reflecting the slow progress Washington has made in opening up China in those sectors. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who will lead the 29 companies that have been approved to travel on the trade mission starting on Nov. 8, said they will be looking for  immediate results  and  tangible agreements . But, speaking at the Paley International Council Summit in New York on Wednesday, he acknowledged that market access, intellectual property rights, and tariffs are more complex and will take a longer time to negotiate.  Some major industrial companies - General Electric Co, Honeywell International Inc and Boeing Co - are among the companies on the current list. Whether executives from all the named companies end up attending could be subject to agreements or deals being negotiated in time for the visit, according to multiple sources whose companies are involved. One of the few tech companies going with Trump is Qualcomm, which earns about half of its global revenue in China and faces a series of tricky legal issues there, including a lawsuit with Apple and the Chinese government s review of its pending $38 billion merger with NXP Semiconductors. Qualcomm said its CEO, Steve Mollenkopf, planned to attend. An industry source told Reuters tech firms were reluctant to go, given China market access issues, the unpredictability of the Trump administration, and a  Section 301  U.S. trade investigation alleging Chinese abuses of intellectual property.  (These) issues are extremely sensitive for tech companies said another source in the U.S. business community.  Very few want to stick their heads up and be perceived as complaining directly, and even fewer trust this White House to do anything helpful on their issues,  he said. Particularly galling to foreign tech firms are a slate of new national security and cyber security regulations, which mandate companies store crucial data within China and pass security reviews they argue could put business secrets at risk. Trump, a real estate magnate who had never before held public office, has had a sometimes testy relationship with corporate America since taking office in January.  He disbanded two high-profile business advisory councils in August after several chief executives quit in protest over his controversial remarks on racist violence in Charlottesville. U.S. industry sources say it has been years since a major business delegation has gone to China during a U.S. presidential visit. Calls for such a delegation during Trump s visit originated in the China-based U.S. business community, according to several sources, who saw a need to match growing efforts by Germany, France and Britain to promote their nation s firms in China. Trump, who has frequently cited the substantial U.S. trade deficit with China as a reason why Washington should take more protectionist measures, was an easy sell on incorporating a group of executives into the visit, according to the sources. Nonetheless, some trade analysts say China has done a good job of taming Trump s combative trade impulses. They worry the U.S. administration will be willing to paper over market access concerns during the visit in its focus on getting Beijing to take action against North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs. Beijing agreed in May to grant limited U.S. access in financial services in bilateral talks aimed at reducing China s trade surplus with the United States which reached $347 billion last year, but business groups complained it was too little, too late. William Zarit, the chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, told Reuters he didn t expect Trump to push hard on market access issues on this trip.  Unfortunately, I think the Chinese aren t going to start to respond until they feel some pain,  Zarit said.  We re all wondering what that is going to mean.  Scott Kennedy, at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington, said Beijing has deflected commercial issues  using a combination of leadership flattery, coaxing up to his (Trump s) family, token concessions, adjusting their level of help on North Korea sanctions, and threats of retaliation should the U.S. take any unilateral action . Agribusiness and energy firms dominate the delegation list. They include Archer Daniels Midland Co (ADM), one of the world s largest grain companies, and chemicals and agribusiness giant DowDuPont. Ten of the companies are involved in gas or other energy fields, including Cheniere Energy Inc, which operates the only U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal, three that are building new projects, and Freepoint Commodities, founded and run by David Messer, who led power utility Sempra s vaunted commodities division.[L2N1N109T] Their presence underscores the U.S. ambition to sell more of its excess gas abroad as its shale revolution contributes to a global LNG glut.  Others on the list who confirmed plans to attend include GE, Houston-based LNG company Delfin Midstream, SolarReserve, Stine Seed Company, biotech firm Drylet, wastewater-processing firm Viroment and the U.S. Soybean Export Council. Bell Helicopter and crane-maker Terex Corp are also on the delegation list. Honeywell, DowDuPont and ADM did not respond immediately to a request for comment and Freepoint, Cheniere, Sempra Energy, and Texas LNG Brownsville LLC said they had no comment. Boeing told Reuters it does not yet have plans to send anyone but that may change. Alaska Gasline Development Corp said it had no information to release. The U.S. Commerce Department, which is leading the delegation, has not yet issued its own list. At least one of the companies on the list tried to distance itself from Trump. SolarReserve told Reuters in a statement that  it had been selected to participate in the commerce department s delegation but stressed that  we are not part of the business delegation travelling to China with President Trump.  One U.S. official told Reuters on condition of anonymity that Trump will tout deals announced during the trip, but they would have likely happened regardless.  The risk is that commercial deals  distract from long-term political solutions  to trade issues, the official said. Evan Medeiros, former President Barack Obama s top Asia adviser, made a similar point in Washington. Beijing would avoid seriously addressing the  underlying systemic problems  such as market access for high-tech goods and intellectual property protection during the visit, he predicted.  The Chinese will be happy to buy a lot of American goods. That s what they know Trump wants   big export numbers,  he said, predicting that China would announce big business deals and allow the president to tout them during his visit.

Kremlin hits at Twitter's 'prejudiced' move against two Russian media outlets,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Twitter s ban on adverts from Russian media was motivated by Washington s  deep prejudices  against Moscow and was setting a worrying precedent for the company to treat its clients unequally, the Kremlin said on Friday. Twitter Inc on Thursday accused Russian media outlets Russia Today (RT) and Sputnik of interfering in the 2016 U.S. election and banned them from buying ads on its network, after criticism in the United States that the social network had not done enough to deter international meddling.  We regret this. We regret that, first and foremost, this company (Twitter) is most probably falling victim to deep prejudices about our mass media,  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a conference call with reporters.  We also regret that the company is actually creating a precedent of unequal treatment of its clients which ... is likely to alarm and worry other users of this network.  In April, Reuters reported that RT and Sputnik were part of a plan by Russian President Vladimir Putin to swing the U.S. presidential election to Donald Trump and undermine voters  faith in the American electoral system, according to three current and four former U.S. officials. The Kremlin has strongly denied U.S. accusations of  meddling in the polls.  We still hope that in the end the company will deem it necessary to analyze this situation in detail and in the end will come to a conclusion that the work of free mass media, which RT and Sputnik are certainly part of, should in no way be qualified as meddling in the electoral process of the U.S.A. or any other country,  Peskov said. He also said that possible new U.S. sanctions against Russia were a cause for concern and a reflection of Washington s  unfriendly and even hostile attitude towards our country . The U.S. State Department said on Thursday it had belatedly begun informing Congress and others about groups associated with the Russian intelligence and defense sectors as required under a 2017 law tightening sanctions on Russia.

UK PM May concerned by reports of sexual harassment in parliament: spokeswoman,"LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May is concerned by a newspaper report describing a culture of sexual harassment among lawmakers and their staff working in parliament, her spokeswoman said on Friday. The report in the Sun newspaper follows dozens of allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein which have prompted hundreds of thousands of women around the world to share their own experiences. The Sun said on Friday that female staff working in London s Westminster political district had created a WhatsApp instant messaging group to discuss their experiences of harassment and warn others about potential perpetrators. It did not name anyone in connection with allegations but cited unnamed members of the group when describing its contents and purpose.    The reports are very concerning, but I can t pre-empt allegations or investigations that haven t come to light yet,  May s spokeswoman said when asked about the Sun story.  The prime minister was very clear when we responded to the reports about Harvey Weinstein in the last few weeks that any unwanted sexual behavior is completely unacceptable, and that is true in any walk of life including politics.  Separately, a group of women members of Britain s opposition Labour Party have set up a website calling on fellow members who have experienced sexual harassment within party ranks to tell their stories anonymously to try and improve Labour s culture.  Any allegations that may come to light would be taken extremely seriously and we would advise people to contact the police if there is such an allegation,  May s spokeswoman said.

Hot air? U.S. gas exporters rush to sell LNG to China,"BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. gas exporters and traders are aiming to grab a bigger chunk of the lucrative, growing business of exporting gas to China, the world s third-largest buyer, when they accompany Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to China next month. But the talk may all be hot air if the U.S. suppliers can t compete with bargain prices agreed on long-term deals with rivals Australia, Qatar and Malaysia. According to a list seen by Reuters, 10 of the 29 companies traveling with Ross and U.S President Donald Trump are involved in energy and gas. [L4N1N228C] Among them are Cheniere Energy Inc, which operates the only U.S. LNG export terminal and Freepoint Commodities, founded and run by David Messer, who led power utility Sempra s vaunted commodities division. [L4N1N228C] Their presence underscores the U.S. ambition to sell more of its excess gas abroad as the U.S. shale revolution threatens to upset the global LNG market. China s appetite has soared as it embarks on an audacious bid to heat millions of homes across the north by gas for the first time this winter and switch tens of thousands of industrial boilers to the cleaner fuel as part of its push to clear the skies.  Without sufficient domestic output to meet growing demand, imports have surged this year, offering huge potential for major exporting nations such as the United States.  We re on the mission to talk to Chinese companies to get something signed up,  said Frederick Jones, founder and chief executive of Delfin Midstream LLC, which is building floating LNG vessels that would sit 50 miles off the coast of Louisiana.  He s heading to Beijing on the trip scheduled to begin on Nov. 8 with his chief financial officer Matthew Weil. Delfin has no customers yet for its new terminal, but hopes to  showcase  the company to state-owned and large private companies. Delfin has been in talks with Chinese buyers for potential offtake deals as well as funds for financing, according to a person with knowledge of the exchanges. A Chinese oil trading executive involved in discussions ahead of the trip expected the delegation to yield several short-term supply deals. (For a graphic on 'LNG market overview' click reut.rs/2z21LDq) In May, the United States and China agreed to boost trade under the  100-day  trade talks aimed at reducing a U.S. trade deficit with China that reached $347 billion last year. Among the agreements is one allowing Chinese buyers to purchase long-term supplies from the United States directly.     Current long-term contracts with Qatar and Australia signed between 2009 and 2013 will expire around 2030/40, but China will need to top up imports to meet growing demand.  Uncertain when the global LNG market will bottom out, Chinese buyers are cautiously avoiding lining up new long-term contracts, but rather are looking at signing five-year or even shorter-term deals based on spot prices, sources said. U.S. imports of LNG have exploded this year.    (For a graphic on 'China LNG Imports by Origin' click reut.rs/2yO1bvM) In the first nine months of the year, shipments hit almost 600,000 tonnes, ranking the United States as the sixth largest LNG importer, leap-frogging Nigeria and Peru.  The average price China paid for U.S. LNG was $7.62 per million of British thermal units (mmBtu) over the past 12 months on a delivered basis, compared to $6.54 for Australia, according to Reuters calculations based on monthly customs data. In 2016, China imported just under 200,000 tonnes of LNG, up from 62,601 tonnes in 2015.  China expects that gas demand will rise to between 320 and 360 billion cubic metres per year by 2020. The increase is the equivalent of the annual consumption of Japan, Asia s second-largest gas consumer after China.

Rights groups urge UK to request Bahrain free activist's relatives,"DUBAI (Reuters) - A group of 13 human rights organizations urged the British government to call for the release of three Bahrainis detained in the Gulf State, saying they were being punished because they were relatives of a London-based activist and his wife. In a letter sent to Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, the group that includes Amnesty International and UK legal charity Reprieve called for the release of Sayed Nazar Alwadaei, Hajar Mansoor Hasan and Mahmood Marzooq Mansoor. The three are relatives of Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei and his wife Duaa Alwadaei. Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei is the director of advocacy at the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy, a Britain-based group campaigning for political change in Bahrain. The three were arrested in March in Bahrain while Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei was attending the 34th session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva.  We therefore urge your government to request Bahrain to immediately release Mr and Mrs Alwadaei s relatives ahead of their October 30 trial and drop all charges against them,  said the letter sent on Thursday. It called the case  part of a pattern of abuse and harassment against human rights defenders and their families in Bahrain . The letter said the three detainees are facing up to three years in jail.  Bahrain is punishing his innocent family as retribution for his peaceful activism,  said Maya Foa, director of Reprieve. Bahrain s government officials could not be immediately reached for a comment. Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei s family members have been under the spotlight of Bahrain s authorities since he took part in protest against the attendance of the Gulf state s king at a royal horse show in Britain. King Hamad attended the Royal Windsor Horse Show last year, and the state-run Bahrain News Agency BNA published his photographs with Britain s Queen Elizabeth II. Bahrain, which has a Shi ite Muslim majority population and is ruled by a Sunni royal family, has seen unrest since the  Arab Spring  protests across the region in 2011.  Many of Bahrain s Shi ites say they suffer discrimination, which the government denies. It accuses Shi ite power Iran of fomenting unrest on its soil, a charged Tehran denies.

Scotland's Sturgeon seeks assurance on Brexit transition,"EDINBURGH (Reuters) - Scotland s first minister Nicola Sturgeon has sought confirmation from Prime Minister Theresa May that Britain is urgently seeking a transition agreement with the European Union before the end of the year. Sturgeon, who heads the devolved government, said in a letter to May she was  increasingly concerned  that Brexit talks would end in no deal and see Britain crash out, following contradictory indications from UK government officials earlier this week.   The clarity of your intentions, and thus the confidence of business that there will be a sensible transition period agreed quickly, has been seriously undermined,  she wrote.  This relates in particular to your comments suggesting no transition can be agreed, or formalized, until there is agreement on the future relationship (with the EU).  The UK government said on Wednesday it wants an agreement of the outline of transitional arrangements in early 2018, and that it expects such an agreement to be quickly and easily reached. Asked about Sturgeon s letter, a spokesman for May said:  We will respond in due course . Uncertainty around formalizing a transition period ahead of agreement on Britain s future relationship with the EU was causing confusion and damaging business confidence, Sturgeon argued. She said she was seeking confirmation that the prime minister was  urgently seeking agreement on a transition arrangement of at least two years, with the aim of securing that agreement by the end of this year.

Mattis talks diplomacy on North Korea ahead of Trump's Asia tour,"PANMUNJOM, South Korea (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis emphasized diplomatic efforts to resolve the North Korean missile and nuclear crisis as he stood at the tense and heavily fortified border between North and South on Friday, saying:  Our goal is not war.  His remarks came before U.S. President Donald Trump - who has threatened to destroy the North if necessary - leaves on his first trip to Asia next week, including a stop in South Korea to meet President Moon Jae-in. For his part, Moon, after talks with Mattis, said the  aggressive deployment  of U.S. strategic assets in the region, which have included overflights by U.S. bombers, had been effective in deterring the North Korean threat. Tension between North Korea and the United States has been building after a series of nuclear and missile tests by Pyongyang and bellicose verbal exchanges between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, stoking fears any miscalculation could lead to an armed confrontation.   North Korean provocations continue to threaten regional and global security despite unanimous condemnation by the United Nations Security Council,  Mattis said in prepared remarks as he visited the demilitarized zone (DMZ).  As Secretary of State Tillerson has made clear, our goal is not war, but rather the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.  Standing alongside Mattis, South Korean Defense Minister Song Young-moo said:  We together will continue to defend peace through strong will and strong might.  Ahead of Trump s visit to Asia, Mattis has emphasized diplomatic efforts to find a peaceful solution to the crisis during his week-long trip to the region.  That s really what it was all about   to keep the (North Korea) effort firmly in the diplomatic lane for resolution,  Mattis said earlier this week after three days of meetings with Asian defense chiefs in the Philippines.  At the same time, the U.S. and South Korean militaries are looking for ways to deter Pyongyang and bolster the South s defenses. Washington s top military officer, Marine General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, met with his South Korean counterpart, General Kyeong Doo Jeong, a U.S. military statement said. Dunford renewed U.S. warnings of retaliation to further provocations.   (Dunford) reaffirmed that any attack by North Korea would be met with a response that will be overwhelming and effective, using the full range of U.S. military capabilities,  the statement said. The United States flew Air Force bombers over waters east of North Korea last month in a show of force. The U.S. Navy, in what it says was a long-planned maneuver, will have three U.S. aircraft carrier strike groups in the Pacific in the coming days.  Last week, CIA chief Mike Pompeo said North Korea could be only months away from developing the ability to hit the United States with nuclear weapons, a scenario Trump has vowed to prevent.  U.S. intelligence experts say Pyongyang believes it needs the weapons to ensure its survival and have been skeptical about diplomatic efforts, focusing on sanctions, to get Pyongyang to denuclearize. The United States on Thursday imposed sanctions on seven North Korean individuals and three entities for  flagrant  human rights abuses, including killings, torture, forced labor and the hunting down of asylum seekers abroad. In a speech last month at the United Nations, Trump threatened to destroy North Korea if necessary to defend the United States and allies. Kim has blasted Trump as  mentally deranged.  Despite the rhetoric, White House officials say Trump is looking for a peaceful resolution. But all options, including military ones, are on the table.   Do we have military options in defense for attack, if our allies are attacked? Of course we do. But everyone is out for a peaceful resolution,  Mattis told reporters traveling with him this week.  No one s rushing for war.  Separately, North Korea released a South Korean fishing boat which had been found to be in North Korean waters illegally, state media said. The crew of 10 - seven South Koreans and three Vietnamese - were released on Friday evening, a spokesman for South Korea s coastguard told Reuters. The return of the boat, which had been reported as missing from Saturday, may have eased already strained relations between North and South. The two sides are technically still at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. The North regularly threatens to destroy the South and the United States.

"Catalonia casts shadow on positive BBVA, Sabadell results","MADRID (Reuters) - Broadly positive results from BBVA and Sabadell were overshadowed on Friday by growing fears over the impact of Catalonia s bid for independence. The crisis has split Catalonia and caused deep resentment around Spain. It has also prompted a flight of business from the wealthy region and alarmed European leaders who fear the crisis could fan separatist sentiment around the continent. BBVA and Sabadell are among the Spanish banks with the highest exposure to the region, where Madrid was preparing to impose direct rule on Friday Shares in Sabadell were the among the worst performers on Spain s Ibex-35 falling 4.5 percent, while BBVA dropped 1.8 percent as investors focused on events in Catalonia.  We did see some movements of deposits during a few days but really nothing material and things have really normalized but there were some days when clients were nervous about the uncertainty,  BBVA s chief executive officer, Carlos Torres, told analysts Deposits in the northeastern region were safe, although if the situation persists it could cut Spanish growth to less than 2.5 percent in 2018, he later added. Although BBVA is based in the northern city of Bilbao it became one of the biggest lenders in Catalonia after buying two former savings banks in the region, Catalunya Banc and Unnim. In an attempt to calm clients, Sabadell decided in early October to move its legal headquarters out of Catalonia. While an economic recovery and a property rebound has allowed most of Spain s banks to tackle toxic balance sheets faster than peers in Italy, the results from BBVA and Sabadell underlined that pressure on revenue from lending remains. Spanish banks are struggling to lift earnings from loans, as interest rates hover at historic lows and increasing competition erodes margins. BBVA s net interest income (NII), or profit from loans minus funding cost, was down around 2 percent against the previous quarter, while Sabadell s NII fell 4 percent. To offset pressure at home, Spanish banks have been expanding abroad in search of higher revenues. BBVA s net profit was up 19 percent up for the period July to September to 1.14 billion euros, slightly above analysts  forecast in a Reuters poll, boosted by Mexico, which accounts for more than 40 percent of its earnings. Net profit at Sabadell however fell 8 percent in the third quarter to 203 million euros, below analysts  forecasts, after its bottom line was impacted by the sale of some its units.  The lender however stuck to its profit target of 800 million euros for 2017. Friday s results showed BBVA, the country s second biggest bank by assets, reduced its non-performing loans by 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion) in the quarter, while Sabadell reduced its problematic assets by 500 million euros. Sabadell s chief executive, Jaime Guardiola, said it would also meet its target of reducing problematic assets by 2 billion euros by year-end despite the political uncertainty. The European Central Bank announced this month new guidelines for lenders to reduce bad loans, although the plans are meeting with a fierce backlash in Italy. Italian banks have more than 210 billion in non-performing exposure, while Spanish banks have combined non-performing loans of 106 billion euros..     ",worldnews,"October 27, 2017 ",Real
Ireland says Brexit talks can't move on without clarity over border,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Britain s talks on exiting the European Union cannot progress, as London wishes, to trade relations until it give more clarity on what will happen at its border with Ireland, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said on Friday. The border with Northern Ireland, which will be the UK s only land frontier with the EU after its departure, is one of three issues Brussels wants broadly solved before talks on trade can start in December at the earliest.  On the border issue, I m sorry but we need more clarity than we have right now. We cannot move ahead to phase two on the back of a promise that we don t see any delivery mechanism to make a reality,  Coveney told a conference.  We don t need all the answers but we certainly need to have more assurance than we have today and we need some understanding that if the trade negotiations collapse, which could happen, that the Irish issues will still be resolved and prioritized.  With close trading links to Britain, Ireland is considered the EU member most at risk when its neighbor leaves the bloc. That means it needs to plan  for all eventualities  and is already doing so, Coveney said. Ireland has called for Britain and the EU to reach a bespoke customs union partnership to eliminate the risk of a  hard  border returning between it and Northern Ireland, which until a 1998 peace deal was separated by military checkpoints because of 30 years of sectarian violence in the province. However, Dublin wants Britain to commit to a fallback option, including potential special arrangements for Northern Ireland, to avoid a customs border should Britain s plan of maintaining the closest possible ties with the EU fall through. If those assurances are forthcoming, Dublin will  probably be Britain s closest friend  in the trade talks but if London maintains its current position, some sort of customs border on the island of Ireland cannot be avoided, Coveney said. Ireland s Central Bank has told Irish firms to do more to prepare for an abrupt British departure and speaking at the same conference, Allied Irish Banks  chairman said Ireland must be ready for a  car crash Brexit.

"Russia undermining action against chemical weapons, says UK, citing Syria 'cover up'","LONDON (Reuters) - British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson on Friday accused Russia of trying to hide the use of sarin gas by Syrian president Bashar al-Assad s government, and said Moscow s behavior was undermining the consensus against chemical weapons. A United Nations report released on Thursday found Assad s government to blame for a chemical attack in Khan Sheikhoun, Syria which killed dozens of people in April and prompted a retaliatory U.S. missile strike. Commenting on the release of that report, Johnson called on the international community to hold Assad s government to account.  He also launched a fierce attack on Russia, which helped broker a deal in 2013 under which Assad agreed to destroy Syria s chemical weapon stockpile.   Russia has repeatedly attempted to disrupt efforts to get to the truth of the Khan Sheikhoun attack,  he said in a statement.  Russia has consistently chosen to cover up for Assad.   This behavior can only undermine the global consensus against the use of chemical weapons. I call on Russia to stop covering up for its abhorrent ally and keep its own commitment to ensure that chemical weapons are never used again.  Russia has defended the Syrian leader against U.S. allegations that his forces carried out the attack, saying there was no evidence. Russia said the chemicals that killed civilians belonged to rebels, not Assad s government.  The Syrian government has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons during the country s more than six-year civil war. Moscow backs Syrian government forces against rebels in the war. The chemical weapons investigation mechanism was unanimously created by the 15-member U.N. Security Council, which includes Russia, in 2015 and renewed in 2016 for another year. Its mandate is due to expire in mid-November, and Russia on Tuesday vetoed a proposal to further extend its mandate.  Russian ambassador to the U.N. Vassily Nebenzia said Russia would consider revisiting the mandate extension after Thursday s report was discussed. Johnson s comments come only weeks after his foreign ministry announced he would travel to Moscow later this year to discuss international security issues.  Johnson has previously described diplomatic relations with Russia as  difficult  but said the British government had a policy of engaging with Moscow  to further mutual interests where they exist . In April, following the sarin gas attack, he canceled what would have been the first visit to Russia in five years by a British foreign secretary.  ",worldnews,"October 27, 2017 ",Real
"As Mattis peers into North Korea, he gets warning on artillery","DEMILITARIZED ZONE, South Korea (Reuters) - As U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis peered into North Korea from a lookout post on Friday, he was given a blunt reminder by his South Korean counterpart of the vast amount of North Korean artillery within range of Seoul.  Above the faint sound of North Korean propaganda music being blasted from across the border, South Korean Defense Minister Song Young-moo suggested that U.S. and South Korean missile defences simply could not stop all of them.  Defending against this many LRAs (long-range artillery) is infeasible in my opinion,  Song told Mattis, citing a need for strategies to  offensively neutralise  the artillery in the event of a conflict. Mattis replied:  Understood.  The brief exchange at the inter-Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) - where U.S .President Donald Trump may visit in coming days - spoke volumes about the risks of any miscalculation as tension soars over Pyongyang s rapidly advancing nuclear weapon and missile programs. Last week, CIA chief Mike Pompeo said North Korea could be only months away from developing the ability to hit the United States with nuclear weapons, a scenario Trump has vowed to prevent. U.S. intelligence experts say Pyongyang believes it needs the weapons to ensure its survival and have been sceptical about diplomatic efforts, focussing on sanctions, to get Pyongyang to willingly denuclearise. But, as the DMZ trip highlighted, North Korea s conventional weaponry poses such a risk to South Korea that any attempt to denuclearize the North by force could easily escalate into a devastating conflict. Mattis was keen to emphasise efforts to peacefully resolve the crisis, including at the DMZ, as he addressed reporters with his back to the dividing line between North and South.   Our goal is not war, but rather the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula,  Mattis said, as North Korean soldiers kept watch. Mattis said he and Song also made clear their mutual commitment  to a diplomatic solution to address North Korea s reckless, outlaw behaviour,  when they met this week at a gathering of Asian defence chiefs in the Philippines. He carried that same message after his helicopter flight back to Seoul, where he addressed a small group of U.S. and South Korean soldiers.  It comes down to you to make it work, my fine young troops ... and we ll buy time for our diplomats to solve this problem,  he said. The emphasis on diplomacy came before Trump departs next week on a trip to Asia. He has declined to say whether he will visit the DMZ when he stops in South Korea, telling reporters on Wednesday:  You ll be surprised.  Trump, in a speech last month at the United Nations, threatened to destroy North Korea if necessary to defend the United States and its allies. Kim has blasted Trump as  mentally deranged.  The bellicose verbal exchanges have stoked fears of a military confrontation, but White House officials say Trump is looking for a peaceful resolution. At the same time, the U.S. and South Korean militaries are looking for ways to deter Pyongyang, and bolster its defences. As Mattis at one point met some of the roughly 28,000 American forces stationed in South Korea, he said the role of U.S. and South Korean troops was essential.  We re doing everything we can to solve this diplomatically, everything we can. But ultimately our diplomats have to be backed up by strong soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines, so they speak from a position of strength,  he said.

Suez says temporarily moves Catalonia office to Madrid,"PARIS (Reuters) - France s Suez, the top water provider in Spain, has temporarily moved the legal registration of its offices in Catalonia to Madrid because of legal uncertainty related to Catalonia s independence movement.  Suez sells water to municipal and industrial customers in Spain where last year it generated 2.5 billion euros of its 15.3 billion euro total revenue.   We have temporarily moved the registered office of Agbar, which is the (Suez) holding company in Catalonia, to Madrid in order to protect the legal certainty of investors, because what we see now in Catalonia is uncertainty,  Chief Financial Officer Christophe Cros said on an earnings call. He said that in 2015 Suez had already moved the legal address of the holding company owning all its activities in Spain from Barcelona to Madrid.  This was not because of politics but because the company wanted to establish a stronger presence in Madrid, as Catalonia makes up only about 50 percent of Suez  revenue in Spain.  Cros said business in Spain in general as well as in Catalonia had been good in the first nine months of the year.  Our business in Catalonia is to deliver water to consumers and I don t expect any change in the need in water,  he said.  In 2015, when Suez finalised its full takeover of Aguas de Barcelona (Agbar), former Agbar minority shareholder Criteria Caixa became Suez  second-largest shareholder and now holds 5.74 percent of its shares. Suez  Spanish water unit Agbar - whose roots go back to 1882 - has over 12,600 staff worldwide and generated 60 percent of its revenue in Spain, the rest mainly in Chile.

Britain believes North Korea was behind 'WannaCry' NHS cyber attack," LONDON (Reuters) - Britain said on Friday it believed North Korea was behind the  WannaCry  cyber attack in May that disrupted businesses and government services worldwide, including the National Health Service (NHS) in England.  Security Minister Ben Wallace said Britain believed  quite strongly  that the ransomware attack came from a foreign state.  ""North Korea was the state that we believe was involved in this worldwide attack on our systems,"" he told BBC radio.   We can be as sure as possible - I can t obviously go into the detailed intelligence but it is widely believed in the community and across a number of countries that North Korea had taken this role.   WannaCry infected more than 300,000 computers in 150 countries in a matter of days, demanding victims pay ransoms starting at $300 to regain access to their machines.  Cyber security researchers quickly identified a possible link to North Korea.  More than a third of England s 236 NHS trusts and an estimated 19,000 appointments were affected, Britain s National Audit Office said on Friday in a report on the attack.  It said WannaCry was a relatively unsophisticated attack that could have been prevented by the NHS had it followed basic IT security best practice.  No NHS organization paid the ransom but the government does not know how much the disruption to services cost the NHS, it said.  Wallace said Britain needed to redouble its efforts to strengthen cyber security.   It s a salient lesson for us all that all of us, from individuals to governments to large organizations, have a role to play in maintaining the security of our networks,  he said.

Alphabet soup as Kazakh leader orders switch to Latin letters,"ALMATY (Reuters) - Kazakhstan is to change its official alphabet for the third time in less than 100 years in what is seen in part as symbolic move to underline its independence. President Nursultan Nazarbayev ordered his office on Thursday to prepare for a switch to a Latin-based alphabet from a Cyrillic one, distancing itself, at least graphically, from Russia. The oil-rich former Soviet republic of 18 million has very close ties with Moscow, its main trading partner, but is also wary of Russia s ambitions to maintain its political influence throughout the region. Kazakh, a Turkic language, used to be written in Arabic script until the 1920s when the Soviet Union briefly introduced a Latin alphabet for it. This was later replaced by a Cyrillic one in 1940, based on the Russian alphabet. Part of the latest switch relates to modern technology. The currently used Cyrillic alphabet has 42 symbols, making it cumbersome to use with digital devices - a standard Kazakh keyboard utilizes almost all number keys in addition to letter and punctuation keys. The latest version of the proposed Latin alphabet works around that by using apostrophe signs to modify letters. The country s official name would thus be spelled as Qazaqstan Respy blikasy. According to a statement published by Nazarbayev s office, he has ordered his chief of staff to draft an executive order introducing the new alphabet. The switch will be gradual, it said. Alhough Kazakh has been the state language since Kazakhstan became independent in 1991, only 62 percent of the population said they were fluent in both written and spoken Kazakh during a the most recent national census in 2009. Russian is more widespread with 85 percent claiming fluency in the same census. Russian is recognized as an official language in Kazakhstan. Several other Turkic nations, including Turkey itself, ex-Soviet Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, have also switched to Latin alphabets. ",worldnews,"October 26, 2017 ",Real
"Australian court rules deputy PM ineligible for parliament, government loses majority","CANBERRA (Reuters) - Australia s High Court ruled on Friday that Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce is ineligible to remain in parliament, a stunning decision that cost the government its one-seat parliamentary majority and forced a by-election. The Australian dollar fell a quarter of a U.S. cent after the unexpected decision. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said he accepted the court s ruling, even though it was  clearly not the outcome we were hoping for . Turnbull did not name a new deputy leader during a short news conference in Canberra soon after the court s ruling. The Australian leader had been scheduled to travel to Israel on Saturday for a week-long visit but a spokesman for Turnbull told Reuters his departure has now been delayed. The spokesman said the new travel arrangements are still be finalised. Turnbull s center-right coalition is now in a precarious position. His Liberal Party is the senior party in a coalition with the smaller National Party, which Joyce led. He must now win the support of one of three independent lawmakers to keep his minority government afloat, with two sitting weeks of parliament left until it recesses for the year. At least two independent lawmakers have promised their support. Independent MP Bob Katter told Reuters he would support the government, but he may reconsider that if the coalition tried to block renewed efforts for a sweeping investigation into the scandal-ridden financial system.  I think we have the numbers for a commission into the banks and, if the government tries to block that, then I think we will get into murky waters,  Katter said. The opposition Labor Party immediately went on the attack and threatened to launch a legal challenge to every decision made by Joyce since last year s election. Joyce was one of a group of lawmakers, known as the  Citizenship Seven , whose eligibility to sit in parliament was thrown into doubt in recent months when it was found they were dual citizens, a status that is barred for politicians under Australia s constitution to prevent split allegiances. Turnbull is under added pressure because he refused to force Joyce to step aside while his case was considered by the High Court. Joyce, whose New England electorate is in rural New South Wales state, renounced his dual New Zealand citizenship in August.  ... the business of government goes on,  Turnbull said as he confirmed that the New England by-election would be held on Dec. 2. Joyce confirmed he would stand in the by-election, which polling shows he has a strong chance of winning.   It is a tough game, politics,  Joyce told reporters in the rural town of Tamworth in his electorate.  You take the hits and the sacrifices.  Acting Labor leader Tanya Plibersek said Turnbull had shown  reckless judgment  in keeping Joyce on the front bench during the court challenge.  We are deeply concerned that Australia is facing a period of uncertainty because this prime minister has insisted on keeping ministers on his front bench who have been not only ineligible to be ministers but ineligible to be in the parliament,  Plibersek said. The Australian dollar fell as low as $0.7623 after the ruling to a level not seen since July 11. It pared some of those losses to last trade at $0.7639 as investors considered Joyce s chances of re-election.  It could dent business sentiment, which has been holding up pretty well,  said Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital.  Should that take a dent, investment and employment could be impacted,  he said. All seven lawmakers accepted that they were dual nationals at the time of their election but claimed they were unaware of their status. Some were conferred a second nationality by birth, others by descent.  Of the remaining six, who were from the coalition and minority parties, four were also found ineligible to hold parliamentary office. Some had already resigned. All were senators, which meant seats in the upper house of parliament could be assigned to party alternatives if they were ruled ineligible, rather than hold more by-elections. Australian Solicitor-General Stephen Donaghue had urged the seven justices of the High Court not to interpret the constitution literally. He argued that five of the seven, including three Cabinet members, should be cleared because they were unaware that they had contravened the constitutional requirement at the time.

"U.N. rights chief decries hunger in Syrian siege, demands aid access","GENEVA (Reuters) - The humanitarian situation in the besieged eastern suburbs of Damascus is  an outrage  and parties to the conflict must allow food and medicine to reach at least 350,000 trapped Syrians, U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra ad al-Hussein said on Friday.  The shocking images of what appear to be severely malnourished children that have emerged in recent days are a frightening indication of the plight of people in Eastern Ghouta, who are now facing a humanitarian emergency,  Zeid said in a statement. The tightening siege has pushed people to the verge of famine in the rebel enclave, residents and aid workers have told Reuters.  I remind all parties that the deliberate starvation of civilians as a method of warfare constitutes a clear violation of international humanitarian law, and may amount to a crime against humanity and/or a war crime,  Zeid said. Zeid s office had a list of several hundred people who needed medical evacuation, but the government had reportedly imposed severe restrictions on such evacuations, leading to the deaths of several civilians, the U.N. statement said.  A U.N. convoy last reached the besieged area on Sept 23, with aid for 25,000 people. Food prices have rocketed since forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad took control of several neighborhoods in May and destroyed tunnels that had been used to smuggle goods into the siege. This month they closed Eastern Ghouta s main access checkpoint and imposed a big rise in taxes imposed on traders. Last week two food warehouses were looted in  a possible sign of growing desperation , the U.N. statement said. ",worldnews,"October 27, 2017 ",Real
"Twitter bans ads from two Russian media outlets, cites election meddling","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Twitter Inc on Thursday accused Russian media outlets Russia Today (RT) and Sputnik of interfering in the 2016 U.S. election and banned them from buying ads on its network, after criticism the social network had not done enough to deter international meddling.  RT and Sputnik condemned the decision, saying Twitter had encouraged ad spending with its sales tactics, while Russia s foreign ministry said the ban was due to U.S. government pressure and that it planned to retaliate.  San Francisco-based Twitter said in an unsigned statement on its website that election meddling is  not something we want  on the social network. It cited a report this year from U.S. intelligence agencies and said it had also done its own investigations of RT and Sputnik.  We did not come to this decision lightly, and are taking this step now as part of our ongoing commitment to help protect the integrity of the user experience on Twitter,  the company said. Twitter, Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc s Google have all recently detected that suspected Russian operatives used their platforms last year to purchase ads and post content that was politically divisive. Russia has denied interfering in the election. Twitter said it would take the estimated $1.9 million it had earned from RT global advertising since 2011 and donate the money  to support external research into the use of Twitter in civic engagement and elections.  The company said it would allow RT and Sputnik to maintain regular, non-ad Twitter accounts in accordance with its rules. RT, an English-language news channel, accused Twitter s sales staff of pressuring it to spend big on advertising in 2016 ahead of the election.   The more money RT spent, the bigger the reach to American voters that Twitter would provide,  RT said, describing the Twitter sales pitch. It said it never  pursued an agenda of influencing the U.S. election through any platforms, including Twitter.  Twitter declined to comment on any discussions with advertisers. A former Twitter employee said the sales pitch to RT is similar to what the company uses to lure advertisers to Twitter, which has struggled to turn a profit.  On Thursday, Twitter said it may become profitable for the first time next quarter after slashing expenses and ramping up deals to sell its data to other companies, which could help to break its reliance on advertising for revenue. Facebook and Google did not immediately respond to questions about whether they would limit Russia media ad spending. In April, Reuters reported that RT and Sputnik were part of a plan by Russian President Vladimir Putin to swing the U.S. presidential election to Donald Trump and undermine voters  faith in the American electoral system, according to three current and four former U.S. officials. On Oct. 19, U.S. lawmakers, alarmed that foreign entities used the internet to influence last year s election, introduced legislation to extend rules governing political advertising on broadcast television, radio and satellite to also cover social media. General counsels for Twitter, Facebook and Google will testify on Nov. 1 before public hearings of the Senate and House intelligence committees on alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.   Twitter is wisely positioning itself to be able to tell the committees that the company has taken steps to address the issues raised,  Adam Sharp, a former Twitter executive, told Reuters on Thursday. The Russian foreign ministry said the ban was a  gross violation  by the United States of the guarantees of free speech.   Retaliatory measures, naturally, will follow,  ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said, according to the RIA news agency. Sputnik, a news agency, said on its website that Twitter s move was regrettable,  especially now that Russia had vowed retaliatory measures against the U.S. media.   Some analysts said transparency, rather than a ban, would have been a better approach. Unlike Facebook, Twitter allows anonymous accounts and automated accounts, or bots, making the service more difficult to police.   Banning any particular person, group or country is just bad policy - in other parts of the world, platforms will come to be viewed as a tool of U.S. or other foreign policy and it will give authoritarian regimes more excuses to ban speech,  Albert Gidari, who as a lawyer has represented tech companies, said in an email. Gidari is now privacy director at Stanford Law School s Center for Internet and Society.  A U.S. lawmaker, Representative Adam Schiff, applauded Twitter s move.   Serving as a platform for free expression does not require assisting foreign powers in their efforts to push propaganda, whether by promoted tweets or other means,  Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement.

Angola's new president takes surprise steps to rein in dos Santos,"LUANDA (Reuters) - Angola s new President Jo o Louren o is making swift moves to wrest power from his predecessor Jose Eduardo dos Santos, pushing out some of his key allies and vowing to combat monopolies controlled by a family that has run Angola for four decades. Dos Santos, 75, handpicked Louren o, 63, to succeed him when he stepped down last month after 38 years in power, prompting critics to suggest the little-known newcomer would be a puppet of the dominant dos Santos family. But analysts, diplomats and politicians have been surprised by the speed at which Louren o has tried to take on some of the entrenched vested interests that control sub-Saharan Africa s third largest economy and second biggest oil exporter. Heavyweights from the previous administration, such as Vice President Manuel Vicente and Minister of State Manuel  Kopelipa  H lder Vieira Dias Jr, have found themselves out of a job. Dos Santos still retains significant power as the head of the ruling MPLA party, and key posts such as the finance minister and central bank governor have not yet been touched. But in the vital oil sector, responsible for 75 percent of government revenue, Louren o curbed the control of dos Santos  daughter, Isabel, who runs national oil company Sonangol. This month Louren o appointed Carlos Saturnino, who was sacked by Isabel dos Santos last year, as Secretary of State for Oil, a technically more senior role than that of his old boss.   It was unexpected at this early stage,  said Marcolino Moco, a former Angolan prime minister and critic of Jose Eduardo dos Santos.   It s very early still, but Louren o is sending a sign that the excesses of the dos Santos era will not continue.  Isabel dos Santos, Africa s richest woman, denied any tension with Louren o, telling Reuters last week that their views were in  full alignment . In his state of the nation address on October 16, Louren o vowed to break up monopolies in the economy, directly mentioning the cement industry in which Isabel and her husband have large holdings. He also abolished government communications department GRECIMA, with which a company co-owned by another dos Santos daughter, Welwitschia, had lucrative contracts. The company, Semba Comunica o, could not be reached for comment.  Breaking the monopolies enjoyed by the dos Santos family would be going for the jugular,  said Ricardo Soares de Oliveira, an author and expert on Angola who teaches at Oxford University.   But there is a danger of confusing a vendetta against dos Santos with a true reform agenda,  Oliveira said. Major reform is desperately needed. Although an oil boom has made Angola one of Africa s richest countries per capita, it is also one of the world s most unequal, with the vast majority of the population sharing little of its wealth. Angola s economy fell into recession last year and unemployment is at least 25 percent. A lack of foreign currency has forced companies, such as airlines and oil services, to pull back operations. A dollar fetches three times the official rate on the black market. Ratings agency Moody s downgraded Angola s credit rating last week, saying the economy remained constrained by foreign currency shortages, high inflation, low public spending and a weak banking system. There are early indications Louren o may be placing capable technocrats into roles to fix some of these problems. Ricardo Viegas de Abreu, a banking executive and former deputy governor of the central bank, was appointed last week Presidential Secretary for Economic Affairs.  Jos  Massano, a former central bank governor popular with international investors, could return to his old job, local media reported Wednesday. A spokesperson for the central bank declined to comment. For Louren o s opponents the jury is still out.  We re still in the phase of promises  action hasn t brought us anything yet,  Adalberto Costa J nior, parliamentary head of main opposition party Unita, told Reuters.

U.S sanctions North Koreans for 'flagrant' rights abuse,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Thursday imposed sanctions on seven North Korean individuals and three entities for  flagrant  human rights abuses, including killings, torture, forced labor and the hunting down of asylum seekers abroad.  Today s sanctions target the North Korean military and regime officials,  U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.  We also are targeting North Korean financial facilitators who attempt to keep the regime afloat with foreign currency earned through forced labor operations.  Among those sanctioned were the director and the deputy director of the Military Security Command, the first vice minister of the Ministry of People s Security and the labor minister. North Korea s consul general in Shenyang, China, and a diplomat at its embassy in Vietnam were also sanctioned.  We are especially concerned with the North Korean military, which operates as secret police, punishing all forms of dissent,  the statement said.  Further, the military operates outside of North Korea to hunt down asylum seekers, and brutally detains and forcibly returns North Korean citizens.  The Treasury statement charged that Ku Sung Sop, the consul general in Shenyang, and Kim Min Chol, the diplomat in Vietnam, had participated in the forced repatriation of North Korean asylum seekers.  Scott Busby, the U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor, told a news briefing that Ku s case had been raised with China. He said it was up to China how to react, but the range of possibilities included expelling him from the country. Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China does not approve of countries using their own domestic law to enact unilateral sanctions outside of the United Nations framework.  We will maintain normal exchanges and cooperation with North Korea on the basis of complying with U.N. resolutions,  he told a daily news briefing, without elaborating. Busby said North Korean government violations included extrajudicial killings, torture, rape and forced abortions and the aim of the sanctions was to send a message, especially to prison camp managers and mid-level officials, that individuals would be held accountable. The U.S. administration has sought to restrict the income North Korea receives from its export of labor as part of efforts to choke off funds helping to finance the country s nuclear and missile programs, which Pyongyang says are aimed at developing weapons capable of hitting the United States. North Korea routinely denies widespread allegations of rights abuses. The Treasury statement said the Ch olhyo n Overseas Construction Company, which was sanctioned along with the Military Security Command and the External Construction Bureau, had operated in Algeria and was reported to earn foreign currency for North Korea.  Employees of Ch olhyo n are kept in slave-like conditions, including having salaries and passports withheld by (North Korean) security officials assigned as site supervisors, meager food rations, poor living conditions, and severe restrictions on their freedom of movement,  the Treasury statement said. It said the External Construction Bureau had operated in Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. ",worldnews,"October 26, 2017 ",Real
North Korea to release captured South Korea fishing boat Friday: KCNA,"SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea said it will release a South Korean fishing vessel on Friday for humanitarian reasons after the boat was found  illegally  in waters under the North s control six days ago, North Korean state news agency KCNA said. The boat and its crew had been captured on Oct. 21 and they will be released  at the designated waters of the military boundary line in the East Sea (38 39 20  latitude, 128 38 10 longitude) at 1800 on Oct. 27,  the news agency report said.  North Korea had reached its decision to release the South Korean boat after  taking into account the fact that all the crewmen honestly admitted their offence, repeatedly apologizing and asking for leniency,  the report said in English. An investigation by the North had  proved  the boat and crew had entered North Korean waters for fishing. North Korean fishing boats, because of age or low fuel, have been found drifting south of the maritime border between the two Koreas at times. Most North Korean crew are released to the North after interrogations by intelligence officials if they wish to return. It is more unusual for South Korean fishing vessels to be found under similar circumstances. The South Korean government could not be immediately reached for comment.

PTI candidate Arbab Amir Ayub clinched 45,631 votes, about 34.8 percent of the total, on Thursday to ensure PTI kept the parliamentary seat in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) that it governs.  The by-election was seen as a litmus test of PTI s popularity in KP, where it has focused on police, health and education reforms in contrast to the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party betting on road and energy infrastructure projects. Khan, the PTI chairman, touted the victory as a  direct vote of confidence  in his party s performance governing KP since the 2013 election, when it won the National Assembly seat, known as Peshawar NA-4, with a majority of about 40 percent. The next general election is due in mid-2018 but Khan has called for early polls after PML-N leader and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was toppled in July by a Supreme Court disqualification over an undeclared source of income. Analysts say Khan s chances of becoming prime minister have been boosted by Sharif s ouster, and the sportsman has doubled down on his populist message by saying he will pull the country away from infrastructure spending towards improving schools, hospitals and the lives of the poor.  Most of the youngsters like Imran Khan and believe he can steer the country out of crisis and stop corruption,  said Zahid Hussain, a government contractor.    Awami National Party (ANP) candidate Khushdil Khan secured 24,830 votes, or 18.9 percent of the total, to pip PML-N s Nasir Khan Musazai, who won 23,169 votes to finish third. Khushdil Khan s showing will hearten the ANP, whose candidates barely campaigned in 2013 as the Pakistani Taliban targeted and killed many of its leaders and activists in KP. But it was the performance of two new hardline religious parties that caught the eye of political observers.  Muhammad Shafiq Ameeni, a candidate for the Tehreek-i-Labaik party, won 7.6 percent of the ballot campaigning on a platform of support for Pakistan s strict blasphemy laws that are already some of the world s harshest. Labaik supporters have spread their hardline message, including the notion that those who commit blasphemy against Islam should be killed, through mosques and seminaries. Syed Moharram Shah, a Labaik activist, said the party was surprised it captured 9,060 votes because it wasn t fully prepared for the election.  This is our first attempt but look at people s response. It s very much encouraging,  he said. Alhaj Liaqat Ali Khan, an independent candidate backed by the Milli Muslim League (MML) party, loyal to Hafiz Saeed, an Islamist under house arrest, obtained 3,557 votes. Washington accuses Saeed of being the mastermind behind the 2008 attacks in the Indian city of Mumbai that killed 166 people, and has placed a $10 million bounty on his head. Saeed denies the charge. Last month, candidates backed by Labaik and MML won about 11 percent of the ballot in a by-election for Sharif s vacated seat in a by-election in the eastern city of Lahore.

Cambodian PM says sanctions wouldn't hurt him,"PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen told his cabinet on Friday he had no fear of Western sanctions after some U.S. senators threatened to push for travel restrictions over his arrest of the main opposition leader, the government spokesman said. Hun Sen s critics accuse him of destroying democracy in Cambodia to ensure that he wins re-election next year to extend more than 32 years in power. U.S. Senator Ted Cruz said he would push for a travel ban on top officials if opposition leader Kem Sokha is not freed by Nov. 9. Senators John McCain and Dick Durbin have also called for travel restrictions if the crackdown continues. Hun Sen told a weekly cabinet meeting that sanctions by Western donors don t worry him, the government spokesman said.  Samdech said he doesn t have wealth abroad and there is no necessity for him to step on U.S. soil,  Phay Siphan told Reuters, using Hun Sen s official title.  Kem Sokha was arrested on Sept. 3 and charged with treason. He is accused of plotting to take power with the help of unspecified Americans - an accusation he denies. The government has also asked the courts to dissolve Kem Sokha s Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) and Hun Sen has called on its members of parliament and other elected officials to defect to his Cambodian People s Party (CPP). Pro-government media said one parliamentarian and some local councillors had defected. Kem Sokha s daughter Monovithya Kem said that if he were not released and the pressure ended on the CNRP, it would mean that next year s election would lack legitimacy.  Hun Sen s government cannot survive without that legitimacy,  she told Reuters.  Cambodia would become a pariah state if the government doesn t reverse course soon.  Western countries have called for the release of Kem Sokha and have intensified lobbying. In an unusually direct statement from Japan, visiting vice minister for foreign affairs Iwao Horii called on Thursday for a free and fair election next year. Japan is Cambodia s biggest aid donor after China.  He expressed the expectation that Cambodia s next national election will be conducted in a free and fair manner,  Hironori Suzuki, Counsellor at the Japanese Embassy, said in an email to Reuters.  He expected that the general election would be held in a way that the international community will welcome.  Hun Sen has been increasingly isolated from Western donor pressure by his strong relationship with China, which has become by far the biggest giver of foreign aid as well as the biggest investor in Cambodia.

"Japanese girl says school forced her to dye hair black, sues government: media","TOKYO (Reuters) - A Japanese teenager is suing the government of Osaka, saying her public high school repeatedly forced her to dye her naturally-brown hair black or be banned from attending school, local media reported on Friday. In a lawsuit filed in Osaka District Court, the 18-year-old girl said her mother informed Kaifukan School in Habikino city upon her enrolment that she was born with brownish hair, as the school had a policy banning hair coloring, media reported. Educators, however, instructed her to color her hair black, telling her repeatedly that the dye job was insufficient and forcing her to  either dye the hair black or quit school , Kyodo news reported, citing the lawsuit. The girl has not attended school since September 2016, suffered pain and irritation from the hair dye, and is seeking damages of about 2.2 million yen ($19,300), said media, adding that Osaka prefecture is asking the court to reject the claim. Masahiko Takahashi, head of Kaifukan School, said he could not comment directly on the case, but noted the school s policy prohibiting students from dyeing or bleaching hair. He declined to say whether it was permissible to dye brown hair to black. The girl could not be reached for comment. In Japan, where conformity is the cultural norm, many schools have strict rules about hair color, accessories, make-up and uniforms, including the length of skirts for girls.

Late Thai king's remains returned to palace after night of tears,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - The ashes and bones of Thailand s King Bhumibol Adulyadej were returned to the palace on Friday as part of an elaborate, five-day cremation ceremony that drew hundreds of thousands of black-clad mourners to Bangkok s historic old quarter. King Bhumibol was the world s longest-reigning monarch when he died a year ago aged 88. His seven-decade rule spanned some of the most tumultuous moments in modern Thai history, including several coups, a deadly crackdown on student protesters, natural disasters and a regional financial crisis. His son, new King Maha Vajiralongkorn, presided over the burning of his father s remains in a golden crematorium at a late-night ceremony in the Thai capital on Thursday. Many mourners stayed to watch as smoke rose from the crematorium. Some broke down in tears. The crowds had diminished on Friday, but thousands of people still lined the streets to glimpse what they could of a ceremony that in total cost $90 million.  I can t express my sadness at the loss. It s like a child longing for a parent,  said Boonpherm Buatho, 56, a housekeeper. Shielded from the sun by a large white-and-gold umbrella, King Vajiralongkorn led a religious ceremony to return his father s remains to the palace. He sprinkled the bones with sacred water as classical Thai music played. The remains were blessed by Thailand s Supreme Patriarch, the head of the order of Buddhist monks. The late king s bones will be taken to the Grand Palace, where he had lain in state since his death last October. Although Thailand does not conduct polls on the monarchy s popularity - partly because of strict laws that protect the royal family from insult - the king built up a wide personal following and is often referred to as  father . The ceremony on Thursday brought Thailand to a standstill as many businesses, including banks, shut to honor the late king. The late king s nine-spired crematorium, built to honor the ninth king of the Chakri Dynasty, features intricate carvings and staircases with sculptures of nagas - a half-human, half- cobra beings - among other mythical creatures. Pictures of mourners wearing black and holding photographs of the late king flooded social media in Thailand, with many using popular hashtags such as #rama9, #kingofkings, and #thegreatestking. On Saturday, a religious ceremony for the late king s remains will take place within the palace. On Sunday, the bones will be transferred to the palace hall where the relics of past kings are kept. A procession will then take his ashes from the palace to be divided between the temples of Wat Rajabopidh and Wat Bovoranives. The first of those temples contains the ashes of many royals. The second is where King Bhumibol was ordained as a monk - a tradition for many Thai men - and is the center of the strict Thammayut sect founded by the late king s great grandfather.

Philippine mobile phone trader 'collected funds' for Marawi attackers,"MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine security forces have arrested a mobile phone trader suspected of collecting funds to help finance pro-Islamic State militants who took over a southern city for five months, police said on Friday. Rasdi Malawani, 42, was paraded in front of the press a day after security forces raided his home in Manila s northern suburbs, where a rocket-propelled grenade and a pistol were seized, Manila police chief Oscar Albayalde said. Malawani was not allowed to speak to reporters and no defense lawyer was present. The military on Monday declared victory over the Maute group, which seized control in Marawi City on May 23, after killing the last 40 remaining militants. More than 1,100 people, including 165 soldiers, were killed in the conflict.  Malawani is the brother-in-law of Maddie Maute, one of the Maute brothers who planned and carried out the Marawi attacks, according to police. They said he had given about 300,000 pesos ($5,800) a month for four months to his sister, Lily. The funds were collected from dozens of tenants of Salaam Bazaar, a mobile phone, accessories and electronic market owned by Farhana Maute, the jailed family matriarch, in a shopping mall in Quezon City, police said. Malawani had been running the business for her.  He is facilitating terrorist financing,  Albayalde said.  He is based here in Manila and is not involved in the fighting. He is considered a supporter and sympathizer.  President Rodrigo Duterte, in a speech before an association of professionals late on Thursday, warned of possible retaliation from militants after the military s victory in Marawi.  Retaliation and vengeance are not far-fetched,  Duterte said.  May I just remind you to be vigilant and always be aware that extremism is the problem of the planet today.  Philippine military chief General Eduardo Ano said on Monday Islamist militants who attacked Marawi on May 23 had received some $1.5 million from Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in January.

Airlines get ready for new U.S. security rules from Thursday," (This October 25 story has been refiled to clarify that IATA CEO remarks referred to March rules) By David Shepardson and Jamie Freed WASHINGTON/TAIPEI (Reuters) - New security measures including stricter passenger screening take effect on Thursday on all U.S.-bound flights to comply with government requirements aimed at responding to threats of hidden explosives, airlines said. Airlines contacted by Reuters said the new measures could include short security interviews with passengers at check-in or the boarding gate, sparking concerns over flight delays and extended processing time. They will affect 325,000 airline passengers on about 2,100 commercial flights arriving daily in the United States, on 180 airlines from 280 airports in 105 countries. U.S. Transportation Security Administration officials are giving some airlines or airports additional time to comply with the new interviews as long the U.S. government has approved security plans by Thursday.  TSA will continue to work closely with our aviation partners and verify that all security enhancements are accurately implemented,  TSA spokeswoman Lucy Martinez said in a statement Wednesday. The United States announced the new rules in June to end its restrictions on carry-on electronic devices on planes coming from 10 airports in eight countries in the Middle East and North Africa in response to concerns that explosives could be hidden in electronic devices. Those restrictions were lifted in July, but the Trump administration said it could reimpose measures on a case by case basis if airlines and airports did not boost security.   European and U.S. officials said at the time that airlines had 120 days to comply with the measures, including increased passenger screening. The 120-day deadline is Thursday. Airlines had until late July to expand explosive trace detection testing.  We see this as a big issue for China Airlines,  Steve Chang, senior vice president of the Taiwanese firm told reporters on Wednesday, adding the airline was trying to consult with the American Institute in the country over the issue.  Korean Airlines, South Korea s flagship carrier, also said it had a lot of concerns with the new measures.   We are asking customers to show up at the airport early ... It s just inconvenient for the passengers,  President and Chief Operating Officer Walter Cho told Reuters in Taipei. Lufthansa Group said on Tuesday the measures would be in place by Thursday and travelers could face short interviews at check-in or at the gate.  Economy passengers on Lufthansa s Swiss airline have been asked to check in at least 90 minutes before departure.  Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd said it would suspend in-town check-in and self bag-drop services for passengers booked on direct flights to the United States. The airline said passengers would also have short security interviews and it has advised travelers to arrive three hours before departure. Singapore Airlines Ltd said the security checks could include inspections of personal electronic devices as well as security questioning during check-in and boarding. Airlines for America, a U.S. trade group, said the changes   are complex security measures  but praised U.S. officials for giving airlines flexibility in meeting the new rules. Alexandre de Juniac, CEO of the International Air Transport Association, said the industry understood security threats to aviation were made regularly but in this case the U.S. government had not shared any specific dangers before announcing the initial Middle East and North Africa electronic device restrictions in March.  What we have seen is very strange,  he told reporters in Taipei.  Unilateral measures announced without any prior consultation... That is something that is very concerning and disturbing.   Airlines were however consulted after the March changes. At their annual meeting in Taipei, Association of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA) members passed a resolution calling for security measures to be risk-based, outcome-focused and proportionate to the probable threat.   Unilateral actions taken by individual governments reacting to emerging threats may result in unnecessary disruption or lead to unintended safety consequences,  said the members. AAPA includes most large Asian airlines but not mainland Chinese carriers.  The risk is other countries make similar demands,  AAPA Director General Andrew Herdman said. U.S. authorities in June also ordered increased security around aircraft and in passenger areas, and other places where travelers can be cleared by U.S. officials before they depart and ordered enhanced screening of personal electronic devices. Some of those new requirements take effect this week as well. The TSA said in July it was imposing new security rules requiring U.S. domestic airline travelers to remove all electronic items larger than mobile phones such as tablets, e-readers and video game consoles from carry-on baggage for screening.

U.N. Security Council to meet Monday on North Korea nuclear test,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations Security Council will meet on Monday on North Korea s nuclear test at the request of the United States, Japan, Britain, France and South Korea, the U.S. mission to the United Nations said in a statement on Sunday. North Korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test on Sunday - in violation of U.N. resolutions - which it said was an advanced hydrogen bomb for a long-range missile. The 15-member Security Council will meet at 10 a.m. (1400 GMT) on Monday, the U.S. mission said.   North Korea has been under U.N. sanctions since 2006 over its ballistic missile and nuclear programs. Typically, China and Russia only view a test of a long-range missile or a nuclear weapon as a trigger for further possible U.N. sanctions. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Sunday that the members of the Security Council  remain unanimous in their commitment to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.  He said any threat to United States, its territories, or allies would be met  with a massive military response.  The council last month unanimously imposed new sanctions on North Korea over its two long-range missile launches in July. The resolution aimed to slash by a third the Asian state s $3 billion annual export revenue by banning exports of coal, iron, lead and seafood. Diplomats have said the council could now consider banning Pyongyang s textile exports and the country s national airline, stop supplies of oil to the government and military, prevent North Koreans from working abroad and add top officials to a blacklist to subject them to an asset freeze and travel ban.   Japan urged Washington last week to propose new sanctions after Pyongyang fired a medium-range missile over North Japan on Tuesday. The United States traditionally drafts resolutions to impose sanctions on North Korea, first negotiating with China before formally involving the remaining 13 council members. Following the nuclear test on Sunday, Britain, Japan and South Korea pushed for new U.N. sanctions, while China and Russia said they would  appropriately deal  with North Korea. Daniel Russel, until April the U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asia and now a senior fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute, told Reuters:  We should expect an uptick in Chinese and Russian pressure on both North Korea and on the United States.   We should also expect  more of the same  from China (and Russia) in claiming that the U.S. is also to blame and calling on Washington to appease Pyongyang with front-loaded concessions and placate it with dialogue, despite the fact that North Korea is clearly only interested in dictating terms, not in negotiating,  he said. Any new sanctions would build on eight resolutions ratcheting up action against Pyongyang over five nuclear tests, four long-range ballistic missile tests and dozens of medium-range rocket launches. The past three substantial resolutions have taken between one and three months to negotiate.  A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the United States, Britain, France, Russia or China to pass.  U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned North Korea s nuclear test on Sunday as  profoundly destabilizing for regional security  and called on the country s leadership to cease such acts, ",worldnews,"September 3, 2017 ",Real
UK says defense commitment in Nordic and Baltic states won't waver after Brexit,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will pledge on Monday that its commitment to security and defense in Nordic and Baltic nations will not change after Brexit, seeking to reassure states affected by what foreign minister Boris Johnson described as  Russian antagonism .

Mexico presidential hopeful rejects comparisons to Venezuela,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The current front-runner for Mexico s 2018 presidential election on Sunday rejected comparisons of his leftist party to Venezuela s socialist government, saying his movement was a Mexican-made revolution against rampant corruption. Former Mexico City Mayor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has led early opinion polls for the 2018 election, supported by frustration with rising crime and corruption scandals that have battered the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).  Just last week, President Enrique Pena Nieto compared the 63-year-old to Venezuela s Nicolas Maduro, suggesting Lopez Obrador could unleash economic chaos if he wins office.  (They are) saying that if MORENA wins Mexico, it s going to be like Venezuela. That s a lie!  Lopez Obrador told a crowd of thousands of supporters who rallied at a monument in the nation s capital.  We re not taking inspiration from any foreign government ... Neither Maduro, nor Donald Trump.  Earlier this year, Pena Nieto s PRI sought to brand Lopez Obrador s National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) an ally of Venezuela. [nL1N1IX09K] Analysts have compared Lopez Obrador s populist appeal to that of Trump. While Trump blamed immigrants and free trade deals for declining incomes among working-class Americans, Lopez Obrador s message is that corruption is keeping Mexicans poor.  People are fed up with corruption,  Lopez Obrador said.  This is the cancer that we are going to end with our movement.  In his annual state of the nation address on Saturday, Pena Nieto did not directly attack Lopez Obrador but he said Mexico faced the choice between backing his reforms, like the opening of the energy sector, that were  transforming  Mexico or  a model from the past that has failed.  Lopez Obrador was the runner-up in Mexico s past two presidential contests. A victory by him could mark a leftward shift in Latin America s second-largest economy, where centrist technocrats have held sway for decades, and further complicate relations with top trade partner the United States. Maduro s government has been criticized by Washington, the United Nations and major Latin American nations for cracking down on protests and failing to allow the entry of foreign humanitarian aid to ease a severe economic crisis. Critics of Lopez Obrador have long sought to depict him as an economic liability, likening him to Maduro s fiery, late predecessor, Hugo Chavez, in previous runs for the presidency.  Pena Nieto told pure lies. He says all these things, but it s all corruption,  said 71-year-old Ana Maria Hurtado as she stood among the crowd at the Lopez Obrador rally.

Trump rebukes South Korea after North Korean bomb test,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump admonished South Korea, a key ally, for what he termed a policy of  appeasement  after North Korea claimed to have tested an advanced hydrogen bomb for a long-range missile on Sunday.  On Twitter, Trump said:  South Korea is finding, as I have told them, that their talk of appeasement with North Korea will not work, they (North Korea) only understand one thing!  It was the latest signal that Trump is losing patience with the international community s response to the increasingly belligerent regime of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Last week, Trump tweeted that  talking is not the answer  in terms of dealing with Pyongyang.  On Sunday, Trump also tweeted that North Korea s  words and actions continue to be very hostile and dangerous to the United States  and said the regime  has become a great threat and embarrassment to China, which is trying to help but with little success.  The White House said Trump s national security team was  monitoring this closely  and that the president would convene a meeting of his advisers later on Sunday.   North Korea said it had tested an advanced hydrogen bomb for a long-range missile on Sunday, setting off a manmade earthquake near the test. Japanese and South Korean officials said that tremor was about 10 times more powerful than the one picked up after the nation s last nuclear test a year ago. There was no independent confirmation that the detonation was a hydrogen bomb rather than a less powerful atomic weapon of the kind Pyongyang has tested in the past. In his tweet on Sunday, Trump appeared to be blaming South Korea for a policy it abandoned years ago of trying to soften North Korea s posture through economic aid.  South Korea s new president, Moon Jae-in, has argued for continuing dialogue with its neighbor over its nuclear program, while also supporting international sanctions.  Reports that the United States is considering pulling out of its trade deal with South Korea has also ratcheted up tensions with the country.  Despite Trump s tweets, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin suggested the United States would continue to attempt to pressure North Korea economically.  Mnuchin said on Sunday that he would put together a package of new sanctions to potentially cut off all global trade with Pyongyang.   If countries want to do business with the United States, they obviously will be working with our allies and others to cut off North Korea economically,  Mnuchin said on  Fox News Sunday.  Trump s cabinet has at times tried to show the president s tweets are not shifts in official U.S. policy. Last week, after Trump said that  talking is not the answer,  Defense Secretary James Mattis followed up by saying:  We re never out of diplomatic solutions.  Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson has previously suggested that the United States would be open to talks with North Korea if it ceased its missile tests and met other conditions.  Senator Jeff Flake, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said on CNN s  State of the Union  on Sunday that the United States had no good options when it came to North Korea.  Obviously the test yesterday shows they are further along than everyone figured,  said Flake, a Republican. He said sanctions did not appear to have slowed the advance of North Korea s nuclear program,  but I don t think harsh rhetoric does either.  Often critical of Trump, Flake declined to address his comment about South Korea s  talk of appeasement,  but said:  I think South Korea will be with us whatever we decide.

But she cautioned against pulling the plug on Turkey s accession talks right now, adding such a step should be considered cautiously. ",worldnews,"September 3, 2017 ",Real
"Iran says jailed U.S. student, dual nationals lose spying appeal","DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran confirmed on Sunday that an appeals court had upheld 10-year jail terms against a U.S. citizen, two Iranian-Americans and a U.S. resident from Lebanon who had been convicted on spying charges. In July, U.S. President Donald Trump warned that Iran would face  new and serious consequences  unless all  unjustly detained  American citizens were released and returned. Tehran prosecutor Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi identified the four as Princeton University student Xiyue Wang, Iranian-American businessman Siamak Namazi and his elderly father Baquer and Nizar Zakka, a Lebanese citizen with permanent U.S. residency, the judiciary s official news website reported.  In Washington, Jared Genser, a lawyer for the Namazis, said in a statement carried by U.S. media last week that their family was informed that a Tehran court had upheld the convictions days earlier. Earlier in August, Princeton University and the wife of Wang, a history doctoral student and U.S. citizen, said they had been informed that Iranian authorities had denied the appeal. Wang was conducting dissertation research in Iran in 2016 when he was detained and charged with  spying under the cover of research , an accusation his family and university denied.  Iran sentenced Zakka, a Lebanese citizen with permanent U.S. residency, to 10 years in prison and a $4.2 million fine in 2016 after he was found guilty of collaborating against the state, according to his U.S.-based lawyer. Zakka, an information technology expert, had been invited to Iran by a government official a year earlier, but then disappeared after attending a conference in Tehran.  Iran s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers lifted most international sanctions and promised Iran s reintegration into the global community in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme. The potential detente with the West has alarmed Iranian hardliners, who have seen a flood of European trade and investment delegations arrive in Tehran to discuss possible deals, according to Iran experts. Security officials have arrested dozens of artists, journalists and businessmen, including Iranians holding joint American, European or Canadian citizenship, as part of a crackdown on  Western infiltration . The arrests have undermined President Hassan Rouhani s goals of reviving business and political ties with the West, as well as pushing for more political and social reforms at home, Iran experts and observers said. A number of Iranian dual nationals from the United States, Britain, Austria, Canada and France have been detained in the past year and are being kept behind bars on charges including espionage and collaborating with hostile governments. According to former prisoners, families of current ones, and diplomats, in some cases the detainees are kept to be used for a prisoner exchange with Western countries.  In January 2016, the United States and Iran reached a historic prisoner swap deal that saw Iranians held or charged in the United States, mostly for sanctions violations, released in return for Americans imprisoned in Iran.

Kenya opposition leader Odinga says he will not share power,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya s opposition leader Raila Odinga said on Sunday that his coalition will not share power, two days after the Supreme Court annulled last month s presidential election and ordered a new poll within 60 days.  The court ruled on Friday that the election board had committed irregularities that rendered the Aug. 8 vote invalid, and overturned incumbent President Uhuru Kenyatta s victory. The ruling set up a new race between Kenyatta, 55, and veteran opponent Odinga, 72, and tension between the two camps has since been rising.  We will not share power,  Odinga said, speaking in Kiswahili outside a church in Nairobi.  We will not divide the loaf,  he said, a local reference to power.  Odinga, who also contested the presidential election in 2007 and 2013, repeated his statement after Friday s court ruling that the opposition would not participate in the re-run of the poll without changes to the election commission. On Friday he had called for the commission to resign and face criminal prosecution. Speaking at a rally in Nairobi attended by thousands of his supporters, he said:  We have said that you cannot force Kenyans to go to the polls that (are) being supervised by thieves.  We will not accept (this),  he said.  We will only go to the elections when we are sure that the ones organizing the elections are people who will not side with one side or the other.      Kenyatta insists the poll should be re-run with the current electoral board.   Though Kenyatta pledged to respect the court s ruling he has, since Friday, referred to justices as  crooks .

Pilgrims return to Mecca as haj winds down without incident,"MECCA (Reuters) - More than two million pilgrims participating in the haj this week began returning to Mecca on Sunday for final prayers as the world s largest annual gathering of Muslims winds down. Senior Saudi officials said the rituals, which have in the past seen deadly stampedes, fires and riots to which authorities sometimes struggled to respond, had gone off without incident. Mecca province governor Prince Khaled al-Faisal, who heads the central haj committee, called this year s pilgrimage a success.  I am proud today to have offered these services and I am proud of all my brothers who participated and I am proud of each pilgrim who came to this land and assisted in the success of this season,  he told reporters in Mina, east of Mecca. Thousands of pilgrims participated in a symbolic stoning of the devil, part of the haj rituals, in Jamarat before returning to Mecca. By nightfall, Mecca s Grand Mosque was crowded with worshippers. Saudi Arabia stakes its reputation on its guardianship of Islam s holiest sites and organizing the pilgrimage. More than 2.3 million pilgrims came to Saudi Arabia this year, most of them from abroad, for the five-day ritual. Attendance is a religious duty, once in a lifetime, for every able-bodied Muslim who can afford it.  The organization was excellent and there was no crowding or anything. Things went well, thanks to God,  said Yemeni pilgrim Rashid Ahmed. More than 100,000 members of the security forces and 30,000 health workers were on hand this week to maintain safety and provide first aid. A crush in 2015 killed nearly 800 pilgrims, according to Riyadh, when two large groups of pilgrims arrived at a crossroads east of Mecca. Counts by countries of repatriated bodies showed over 2,000 people may have died, including more than 400 Iranians. Tehran sent nearly 90,000 pilgrims to the haj this year after boycotting the event last year amid a diplomatic rift with Riyadh. Saudi Health Minister Tawfiq al-Rabeeah said the pilgrimage had passed without any outbreak of disease, a perennial concern. He told Reuters in an interview late on Saturday that the ministry had also provided care to 400,000 people, including 21 open-heart surgeries.  We are keen to offer excellent service so that the pilgrims return home in good health after completing the haj,  he said. ",worldnews,"September 3, 2017 ",Real
"Vote ruling by chief justice surprises Kenyans, but not his colleagues","NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya s Supreme Court ruling to scrap last month s presidential election was shaped by a new chief justice who proved a staunch defender of judicial independence on a continent where judges are often seen as being under the thumb of executive powers. David Maraga s declaration that the Aug. 8 election was void and demand for a new poll with 60 days shocked many in the East African nation and abroad. But his announcement, after a 4-2 vote by a court panel to annul the vote, didn t surprise those who know the chief justice.  We knew this case was coming and he was the man to hear it,  Professor Tom Ojienda, who worked with Maraga and sits on the Judicial Service Commission that appointed him chief justice, told Reuters.  He is a stickler for the rules.  President Uhuru Kenyatta, who was expected to be sworn in for a second term until Friday s Supreme Court ruling, said he respected the decision. But he took a swipe at Maraga s colleagues, calling them  crooks  and saying the judiciary needed fixing. Kenya, a U.S. ally in the fight against Islamists and a trade gateway to East Africa, has a history of disputed votes. A  row after the 2007 vote led to ethnic bloodshed that killed more than 1,200 people. In 2013, a bid by veteran opponent Raila Odinga to secure an election rerun was rejected by the Supreme Court. This time, the opposition changed tack in their petition. Instead of seeking to prove enough votes were fake to undermine the vote - an almost impossible task in the two weeks the court had to give its judgment - Odinga s supporters sought to demonstrate that the online tallying process lacked integrity. The new approach may have been a key factor in securing a decision that had the backing of four of the panel s six judges, who have three weeks from the ruling to publish details of their decision. But the opposition also found in the chief justice a man ready to defend judicial powers against the highest office and unswayed by a tendency in Kenya, a nation of more than 40 ethnic groups, for voters to back fellow clans people. Within months of his appointment in October, Maraga called out Kenyatta for telling voters on a campaign stop in Maraga s home region of Nyamira County in April that  their son  had a job. Maraga responded that his appointment had nothing to do with the president. Kenyatta is a Kikuyu, Kenya s biggest ethnic group but still a minority. Odinga is a Luo, another big grouping. The chief justice is Kisii, a smaller group from Kenya s western highlands. Maraga also sent a clear message to national leaders on Aug. 2 that the judiciary was above the political fray.  The emerging culture of public lynching of judges and judicial officers by the political class is a vile affront to the rule of law and must be fiercely resisted,  he said in a statement. Maraga did not immediately issue a response to Kenyatta s latest comments. Reuters could not reach him for comment. Kenyans have long complained that getting any official business done requires a  kitu kidogo , Swahili for  a little something  or bribe, a frustration that is echoed across Africa. But Kenya has slowly rebuilt confidence in its judiciary after the post-2007 vote violence. A new constitution in 2010 demanded reforms of the judiciary and other public institutions. Maraga, who has risen the ranks as those reforms have been implement, was known by colleagues for his strict adherence to the rules even as a young lawyer. A devout Christian of the Seventh Day Adventist tradition, he built his practice in the Rift Valley city of Nakuru rather than to Nairobi where he where he could have secured more high profile cases and would have more easily rubbed shoulders with the rich and powerful, his colleagues said.  If a client gave you any problem, or asked for anything  that was wrong, or refused to pay, (Maraga) would just say,  Let him go. Other ones will come ,  said Professor Ojienda said. Maraga s integrity and record of strictly interpreting election procedures in past polls swayed the commission to appoint him last October, Ojienda said. The opposition s high hopes in 2013 that it could overturn that election result were dashed. Supreme Court judges, then led by Maraga s predecessor Willy Mutunga, rejected their petition. This time, even Odinga - a former prime minister who has fought and lost three presidential races including this one - seemed surprised. After listening to Friday s ruling in court, he broke out into a broad grin and pumped his fist in the air. Since 2013, several new judges were appointed to the Supreme Court s seven-strong panel. Friday s decision was backed by Maraga and two others appointed after 2013. Another, who had been on the panel in 2013, also backed the ruling. Two judges dissented, while one was ill and did not vote.  An election is not an event, it is a process from the beginning to the end,  Maraga said before reading the ruling. Four years earlier, the opposition had some of their arguments thrown out as they were lodged too late, while their complaints about the widespread failure of the electronic voting systems failed to convince the judges. This time, the opposition case hinged on the election board s failure to post online tally forms from each of the 40,883 polling stations before announcing results. The forms were supposed to be signed by each party s agent, as a hard-copy backup to the electronic transmission. But thousands of forms were missing from the board s website when it announced results. A report by independent court-appointed experts found many forms lacked official stamps, signatures or serial numbers. That was enough to convince a majority in Maraga s panel.

Myanmar urges Rohingya Muslims to help hunt insurgents amid deadly violence,"COX S BAZAR, Bangladesh/YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar urged Muslims in the troubled northwest to cooperate in the search for insurgents, whose coordinated attacks on security posts and an army crackdown have led to one of the deadliest bouts of violence to engulf the Rohingya community in decades. The treatment of Buddhist-majority Myanmar s roughly 1.1 million Muslim Rohingya is the biggest challenge facing leader Aung San Suu Kyi, accused by Western critics of not speaking out for the minority that has long complained of persecution. Aid agencies estimate that about 73,000 Rohingya have fled into neighbouring Bangladesh from Myanmar since violence erupted last week, Vivian Tan, regional spokeswoman for U.N. refugee agency UNHCR, told Reuters on Sunday. Hundreds more refugees on Sunday walked through rice paddies from the Naf river separating the two countries into Bangladesh, straining scarce resources of aid groups and local communities already helping tens of thousands.  The clashes and military counter-offensive have killed nearly 400 people during the past week.   Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday that violence against Muslims amounted to genocide.      It marks a dramatic escalation of a conflict that has simmered since October, when a smaller Rohingya attack on security posts prompted a military response dogged by allegations of rights abuses.  Islamic villagers in northern Maungtaw have been urged over loudspeakers to cooperate when security forces search for Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) extremist terrorists, and not to pose a threat or brandish weapons when security forces enter their villages,  a report in state-run newspaper Global New Light of Myanmar said on Sunday.  ARSA has been declared a terrorist organisation by the government. The group claimed responsibility for coordinated attacks on security posts last week.  In Maungni village in northern Rakhine, villagers this week caught two ARSA members and handed them over to the authorities, the newspaper added.  The army wrote in a Facebook post on Sunday that Rohingya insurgents had set fire to monasteries, images of Buddha as well as schools and houses in northern Rakhine.  More than 200 buildings, including houses and shops, were destroyed across several villages, the army said. While Myanmar officials blamed the ARSA for the burning of homes, Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh and human rights watchers say that a campaign of arson and killings by the army is aimed at trying to force out the minority group.  On a Twitter account believed to be linked to the ARSA, the group accused the Myanmar army of  causing terror and destruction to the ethnic Rohingya population . About a hundred protesters gathered in Myanmar s commercial capital Yangon on Sunday, calling for the authorities to step up security measures in northern Rakhine to protect ethnic Rakhine Buddhists.  I want the government to protect the people (from insurgents) without any hesitation,  said Zin Lin Aung, a university student.  More than 11,700  ethnic residents  had been evacuated from northern Rakhine, the government has said, referring to non-Muslims. In Bangladesh, authorities said that at least 53 bodies of Rohingya had either been found floating in the Naf river or washed up on the beach in the past week as tens of thousands continue to try to flee the violence. A senior leader of al Qaeda s Yemeni branch has called for attacks on Myanmar authorities in support of the Rohingya.  Amid mounting anger over the violence against Rohingya in Indonesia, home to the world s biggest Muslim population, a petrol bomb was thrown at the Myanmar embassy in Jakarta on Sunday, causing a small fire. Separately, hundreds protested in Jakarta, calling on the Indonesian government to take an active role in bringing a halt to human rights violations against the Rohingya.    Former colonial ruler Britain said on Saturday that it hoped Suu Kyi would use her  remarkable qualities  to end the violence.  ",worldnews,"September 3, 2017 ",Real
Indonesian envoy to urge Myanmar to halt violence against Rohingya Muslims,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian President Joko Widodo has sent his foreign minister to Myanmar to urge its government to halt violence against Rohingya Muslims, he said on Sunday after a petrol bomb was thrown at the Myanmar embassy in Jakarta. The embassy attack, which police said caused a small fire, came in the early hours of Sunday morning against the backdrop of mounting anger in Indonesia, home to the world s biggest Muslim population, over violence against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. A police officer patrolling a street behind the embassy spotted a fire on the second floor of the building at about 0235 Jakarta time (GMT+7) and alerted police officers guarding the front gate, a Jakarta police statement said. After the fire was extinguished, police found a shattered beer bottle with a wick attached to it, the statement said, adding that the unknown perpetrator is suspected to have driven away from the scene in an MPV car. Jakarta police are investigating the incident, said spokesman Argo Yuwono. A group of activists had held a protest at the embassy on Saturday, calling for the Nobel Prize Committee to withdraw the Nobel Peace Prize from Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi, state news agency Antara wrote. (bit.ly/2eRowl0) Protests continued on Sunday in Jakarta s city center, with dozens of people calling for the Indonesian government to take an active involvement in efforts to end human rights violations  against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. Indonesian President Widodo said he has sent Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi to Myanmar to hold  intensive communications  with involved parties including the United Nations.  Earlier this afternoon the Foreign Minister has departed to Myanmar to ask the Myanmar government to stop and prevent violence, to provide protection to all citizens, including Muslims in Myanmar, and to give access to humanitarian aid,  Widodo said.     Widodo added that concrete actions are needed and the Indonesian government is committed to helping to solve the humanitarian crisis and that Marsudi will also travel to Bangladesh to prepare additional aid for refugees there.

North Korean nuclear test prompts global condemnation,"LONDON (Reuters) - North Korea s biggest nuclear test to date was condemned around the world on Sunday, with several leaders calling for new sanctions and U.S. President Donald Trump saying  appeasement  would not work. The explosion of what North Korea said was an advanced hydrogen bomb came just days after it fired a missile over Japan.  Trump, who said after last week s missile launch that talking to Pyongyang  is not the answer , tweeted that Sunday s test showed North Korea s  words and actions continue to be very hostile and dangerous to the United States . U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said he would put together new sanctions to potentially cut off all North Korea s global trade.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron said they planned to tighten European Union sanctions.  This latest provocation by the ruler in Pyongyang has reached a new dimension,  the German government said in a statement after Merkel and Macron discussed the issue by phone. Britain s foreign minister Boris Johnson said:  They (North Korea) seem to be moving closer towards a hydrogen bomb which, if fitted to a successful missile, would unquestionably present a new order of threat,  adding that there were no palatable military solutions.  British Prime Minister Theresa May said the U.N. Security Council should urgently look at new measures. Russia struck a cautious tone.  In the emerging conditions it is absolutely essential to keep cool, refrain from any actions that could lead to a further escalation of tensions,  Russia s foreign ministry said, adding that North Korea risked  serious consequences . Later on Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin met his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in China where they agreed to  appropriately deal with  the crisis, Chinese state news agency Xinhua said.  The two leaders agreed to stick to the goal of denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula and keep close communication and coordination to deal with the new situation,  Xinhua said. Earlier, China urged North Korea to stop  wrong  actions and said it would fully enforce U.N. resolutions on the country. As North Korea s most important trading partner, the position of China - a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council - will be closely watched. A Japanese government source said there would be pressure on Beijing to impose an oil embargo.  They will probably act eventually but ... it is possible that will not be before their October (party) convention,  the source said.  Russia does not have real influence on North Korea. It s China that matters.  Trump said North Korea had become  a great threat and embarrassment to China  and that Beijing had tried but failed to solve the problem. What he called South Korea s  talk of appeasement  would not work as  they (the North Koreans) only understand one thing!  The International Atomic Energy Agency, which has no access to North Korea, called the nuclear test, Pyongyang s sixth since 2006,  an extremely regrettable act  that was  in complete disregard of the repeated demands of the international community .

"Iran says warns off U.S. U2 spy plane, drone","DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran s air defenses have forced an approaching U.S. spy plane and a reconnaissance drone to change course near its air space over the past six months, a military official was quoted as saying on Sunday . Brigadier General Farzad Esmaili, commander of the Iran s air defense force, said an unmanned RQ-4 drone was intercepted last week and a U2 spy plane was warned away in March, the semi-official Fars news agency reported.

"Main Cambodian opposition leader arrested, paper shuts as crackdown grows","PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodia s main opposition leader Kem Sokha was arrested and accused of treason on Sunday and a leading independent paper said it was being forced to shut down as Prime Minister Hun Sen s government intensified a crackdown on his critics. Hun Sen said Kem Sokha had been plotting with the United States, increasing his anti-American rhetoric as Cambodia heads towards elections next year in which the authoritarian leader s grip of more than three decades is at stake. The U.S. State Department expressed concern at the arrest of Ken Sokha and action against the media. It raised doubt over whether the Southeast Asian country can hold a fair election. Hun Sen, 65, a former Khmer Rouge cadre, who is now one of China s closest regional allies, said Kem Sokha had been arrested for treason in which the United States was implicated.  It s an act of treason with conspiracy with a foreign country, betraying his own nation. This requires arrest,  Hun Sen told a group of garment workers, according to the pro-government Fresh News website. Kem Sokha, 64, has led the main opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) since his predecessor resigned in February, saying he feared a government plan to shut it down. Kem Sokha was taken from his home in handcuffs after a night-time police raid. The opposition party lost to Hun Sen s Cambodian People s Party in local elections in June, but it did well enough to increase expectations of a close contest in the 2018 vote. The government released a video on its Facebook page in which Kem Sokha appeared to tell a group of supporters about a strategy to win power which he said had the support of  the Americans  rather than an immediate plot to topple Hun Sen. In the video, Kem Sokha said the Americans had hired academics to advise on strategy to change Cambodia s leaders.  And if I follow such a tactic and strategy and if I could not win, I do not know what else to do,  he said. The opposition party made no immediate comment on the veracity or content of the video. Earlier, it said Kem Sokha s arrest was politically motivated and violated the law because of the immunity granted to elected lawmakers. The party called for his release and urged the international community to intervene. If Kem Sokha is found guilty of any offence, it could allow the government to shut the party under a new law. Kem Sokha made no immediate comment and it was not clear if he had been charged or had legal representation at this stage. The government has stepped up attacks on the United States and last month ordered the expulsion of the U.S. State Department-funded National Democratic Institute pro-democracy group. Earlier in the year, it suspended joint military exercises with the United States, which has voiced fears over the human rights situation. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the charges against Kem Sokha appeared to be politically motivated. Her statement did not directly address Hun Sen s accusations against the United States. Nauert also highlighted recent steps by the Cambodian government against independent media and civil society, saying they  raise serious questions about the government s ability to organize credible national elections in 2018 which produce an outcome that enjoys democratic legitimacy . In a sign of the pressure on the media, The Cambodia Daily said it was ceasing publication after the government ordered it to pay a crippling $6.3 million tax bill by Monday. The English-language paper, founded by an American journalist, was known for critical coverage of issues such as corruption, human rights and the environment.  After 24 years and 15 days, the Cambodian government has destroyed The Cambodia Daily, a special and singular part of Cambodia s free press,  it said in a statement. During Hun Sen s rule Cambodia emerged from the devastating Khmer Rouge genocide to enjoy record years of economic growth of  above 7 percent, but disaffection has been increasing and he only just won the 2013 election against a unified opposition.

U.S.-led coalition says Islamic State Syria convoy split in two,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - An Islamic State evacuation convoy trying to reach IS territory in east Syria has split in two, with some buses remaining in the open desert after others turned back into government-held areas, a U.S.-led coalition fighting the group said on Sunday.  The Syrian government and Lebanon s Hezbollah group offered the convoy of about 300 lightly armed fighters and about 300 family members safe passage a week ago in return for Islamic State surrendering an enclave on the Syria-Lebanon border.  However, the coalition has blocked the convoy from entering Islamic State territory in east Syria, near the border with Iraq, by cratering roads and destroying bridges, saying it opposes the evacuation deal as being  not a lasting solution .   One group remains in the open desert to the north west of Al-Bukamal and the other group has headed west towards Palmyra,  the coalition said in an emailed statement. On Saturday Hezbollah said all but six of the buses had safely crossed out of Syrian government territory and were no longer the responsibility of it or the Syrian government. It warned the United States that the buses in the desert included elderly people, pregnant women and casualties, and accused it of stopping humanitarian aid reaching the convoy. The coalition said it had contacted Russia to deliver a message to the Syrian government that it would still not let the convoy pass, and that it had offered suggestions on how to save the civilians in it from suffering.   Food and water have been provided to the convoy,  it said, without giving further details.  The coalition has said it will not target the convoy directly while it contains civilians, but said in its statement it had struck about 85 IS fighters near the convoy.  It had also struck about 40 IS vehicles near the convoy including a tank, an artillery system, armed vehicles and transport vehicles seeking to help move the fighters in the convoy into its territory, it said.

 Drunk Bragging Trump Staffer Started Russian Collusion Investigation,"House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes is going to have a bad day. He s been under the assumption, like many of us, that the Christopher Steele-dossier was what prompted the Russia investigation so he s been lashing out at the Department of Justice and the FBI in order to protect Trump. As it happens, the dossier is not what started the investigation, according to documents obtained by the New York Times.Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos was drunk in a wine bar when he revealed knowledge of Russian opposition research on Hillary Clinton.On top of that, Papadopoulos wasn t just a covfefe boy for Trump, as his administration has alleged. He had a much larger role, but none so damning as being a drunken fool in a wine bar. Coffee boys  don t help to arrange a New York meeting between Trump and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt two months before the election. It was known before that the former aide set up meetings with world leaders for Trump, but team Trump ran with him being merely a coffee boy.In May 2016, Papadopoulos revealed to Australian diplomat Alexander Downer that Russian officials were shopping around possible dirt on then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Exactly how much Mr. Papadopoulos said that night at the Kensington Wine Rooms with the Australian, Alexander Downer, is unclear,  the report states.  But two months later, when leaked Democratic emails began appearing online, Australian officials passed the information about Mr. Papadopoulos to their American counterparts, according to four current and former American and foreign officials with direct knowledge of the Australians  role. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. and is now a cooperating witness with Special Counsel Robert Mueller s team.This isn t a presidency.

 Sheriff David Clarke Becomes An Internet Joke For Threatening To Poke People â€˜In The Eyeâ€™,"On Friday, it was revealed that former Milwaukee Sheriff David Clarke, who was being considered for Homeland Security Secretary in Donald Trump s administration, has an email scandal of his own.In January, there was a brief run-in on a plane between Clarke and fellow passenger Dan Black, who he later had detained by the police for no reason whatsoever, except that maybe his feelings were hurt. Clarke messaged the police to stop Black after he deplaned, and now, a search warrant has been executed by the FBI to see the exchanges.Clarke is calling it fake news even though copies of the search warrant are on the Internet.

 Pope Francis Just Called Out Donald Trump During His Christmas Speech,"Pope Francis used his annual Christmas Day message to rebuke Donald Trump without even mentioning his name. The Pope delivered his message just days after members of the United Nations condemned Trump s move to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The Pontiff prayed on Monday for the  peaceful coexistence of two states within mutually agreed and internationally recognized borders. We see Jesus in the children of the Middle East who continue to suffer because of growing tensions between Israelis and Palestinians,  Francis said.  On this festive day, let us ask the Lord for peace for Jerusalem and for all the Holy Land. Let us pray that the will to resume dialogue may prevail between the parties and that a negotiated solution can finally be reached. The Pope went on to plead for acceptance of refugees who have been forced from their homes, and that is an issue Trump continues to fight against. Francis used Jesus for which there was  no place in the inn  as an analogy. Today, as the winds of war are blowing in our world and an outdated model of development continues to produce human, societal and environmental decline, Christmas invites us to focus on the sign of the Child and to recognize him in the faces of little children, especially those for whom, like Jesus,  there is no place in the inn,  he said. Jesus knows well the pain of not being welcomed and how hard it is not to have a place to lay one s head,  he added.  May our hearts not be closed as they were in the homes of Bethlehem. The Pope said that Mary and Joseph were immigrants who struggled to find a safe place to stay in Bethlehem. They had to leave their people, their home, and their land,  Francis said.  This was no comfortable or easy journey for a young couple about to have a child.   At heart, they were full of hope and expectation because of the child about to be born; yet their steps were weighed down by the uncertainties and dangers that attend those who have to leave their home behind. So many other footsteps are hidden in the footsteps of Joseph and Mary,  Francis said Sunday. We see the tracks of entire families forced to set out in our own day. We see the tracks of millions of persons who do not choose to go away, but driven from their land, leave behind their dear ones. Amen to that.Photo by Christopher Furlong/Getty Images.",News,"December 25, 2017",Fake
 Racist Alabama Cops Brutalize Black Boy While He Is In Handcuffs (GRAPHIC IMAGES),"The number of cases of cops brutalizing and killing people of color seems to see no end. Now, we have another case that needs to be shared far and wide. An Alabama woman by the name of Angela Williams shared a graphic photo of her son, lying in a hospital bed with a beaten and fractured face, on Facebook. It needs to be shared far and wide, because this is unacceptable.It is unclear why Williams  son was in police custody or what sort of altercation resulted in his arrest, but when you see the photo you will realize that these details matter not. Cops are not supposed to beat and brutalize those in their custody. In the post you are about to see, Ms. Williams expresses her hope that the cops had their body cameras on while they were beating her son, but I think we all know that there will be some kind of convenient  malfunction  to explain away the lack of existence of dash or body camera footage of what was clearly a brutal beating. Hell, it could even be described as attempted murder. Something tells me that this young man will never be the same. Without further ado, here is what Troy, Alabama s finest decided was appropriate treatment of Angela Williams  son:No matter what the perceived crime of this young man might be, this is completely unacceptable. The cops who did this need to rot in jail for a long, long time   but what you wanna bet they get a paid vacation while the force  investigates  itself, only to have the officers returned to duty posthaste?This, folks, is why we say BLACK LIVES MATTER.

" Fresh Off The Golf Course, Trump Lashes Out At FBI Deputy Director And James Comey","Donald Trump spent a good portion of his day at his golf club, marking the 84th day he s done so since taking the oath of office. It must have been a bad game because just after that, Trump lashed out at FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe on Twitter following a report saying McCabe plans to retire in a few months. The report follows McCabe s testimony in front of congressional committees this week, as well as mounting criticism from Republicans regarding the Russia probe.So, naturally, Trump attacked McCabe with a lie. How can FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, the man in charge, along with leakin  James Comey, of the Phony Hillary Clinton investigation (including her 33,000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700,000 for wife s campaign by Clinton Puppets during investigation?

And the implication that McCabe got Clinton off as a political favor doesn t make much sense when we look at the evidence. His July tweet was rated  mostly false.

" Trump Said Some INSANELY Racist Stuff Inside The Oval Office, And Witnesses Back It Up","In the wake of yet another court decision that derailed Donald Trump s plan to bar Muslims from entering the United States, the New York Times published a report on Saturday morning detailing the president s frustration at not getting his way   and how far back that frustration goes.According to the article, back in June, Trump stomped into the Oval Office, furious about the state of the travel ban, which he thought would be implemented and fully in place by then. Instead, he fumed, visas had already been issued to immigrants at such a rate that his  friends were calling to say he looked like a fool  after making his broad pronouncements.It was then that Trump began reading from a document that a top advisor, noted white supremacist Stephen Miller, had handed him just before the meeting with his Cabinet. The page listed how many visas had been issued this year, and included 2,500 from Afghanistan (a country not on the travel ban), 15,000 from Haiti (also not included), and 40,000 from Nigeria (sensing a pattern yet?), and Trump expressed his dismay at each.According to witnesses in the room who spoke to the Times on condition of anonymity, and who were interviewed along with three dozen others for the article, Trump called out each country for its faults as he read: Afghanistan was a  terrorist haven,  the people of Nigeria would  never go back to their huts once they saw the glory of America, and immigrants from Haiti  all have AIDS. Despite the extensive research done by the newspaper, the White House of course denies that any such language was used.But given Trump s racist history and his advisor Stephen Miller s blatant white nationalism, it would be no surprise if a Freedom of Information Act request turned up that the document in question had the statements printed inline as commentary for the president to punctuate his anger with. It was Miller, after all, who was responsible for the  American Carnage  speech that Trump delivered at his inauguration.This racist is a menace to America, and he doesn t represent anything that this country stands for.

" Former CIA Director Slams Trump Over UN Bullying, Openly Suggests Heâ€™s Acting Like A Dictator (TWEET)","Many people have raised the alarm regarding the fact that Donald Trump is dangerously close to becoming an autocrat. The thing is, democracies become autocracies right under the people s noses, because they can often look like democracies in the beginning phases. This was explained by Republican David Frum just a couple of months into Donald Trump s presidency, in a piece in The Atlantic called  How to Build an Autocracy. In fact, if you really look critically at what is happening right now   the systematic discrediting of vital institutions such as the free press and the Federal Bureau of Investigation as well the direct weaponization of the Department of Justice in order to go after Trump s former political opponent, 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and you have the makings of an autocracy. We are more than well on our way. Further, one chamber of Congress, the House of Representatives, already has a rogue band of Republicans who are running a parallel investigation to the official Russian collusion investigation, with the explicit intent of undermining and discrediting the idea that Trump could have possibly done anything wrong with the Russians in order to swing the 2016 election in his favor.All of that is just for starters, too. Now, we have Trump making United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley bully and threaten other countries in the United Nations who voted against Trump s decision to change U.S. policy when it comes to recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of the Jewish State. Well, one expert, who is usually quite measured, has had enough of Trump s autocratic antics: Former CIA Director John O. Brennan. The seasoned spy took to Trump s favorite platform, Twitter, and blasted the decision:Trump Admin threat to retaliate against nations that exercise sovereign right in UN to oppose US position on Jerusalem is beyond outrageous. Shows @realDonaldTrump expects blind loyalty and subservience from everyone qualities usually found in narcissistic, vengeful autocrats.  John O. Brennan (@JohnBrennan) December 21, 2017Director Brennan is correct, of course. Trump is behaving just like an autocrat, and so many people in the nation are asleep when it comes to this dangerous age, in which the greatest threat to democracy and the very fabric of the republic itself is the American president. Fellow Americans, we know the GOP-led Congress will not be the check on Trump that they are supposed to be. It s time to get out and flip the House and possibly the Senate in 2018, and resist in the meantime, if we want to save our country from devolving into something that looks more like Russia or North Korea than the America we have always know.

America First Policies is set to release this ad, called  Thank You, President Trump,  on Christmas Day and, well, we threw up a little in our mouths trying to watch this.Basically, the spot is nothing but people fawning all over Trump for all the stuff he hasn t actually done. The ad includes a scene with a little girl thanking Trump for bringing back  Merry Christmas,  which never went away (there are even videos of President Obama saying  Merry Christmas  himself).

" Papa Johnâ€™s Founder Retires, Figures Out Racism Is Bad For Business","A centerpiece of Donald Trump s campaign, and now his presidency, has been his white supremacist ways.

Nothing could be further from the truth, and they re getting hammered on that repeatedly. Speaking on CNBC, Paul Ryan was going full throttle, trying to convince us that the paltry savings we re getting is actually wait for it big money.But he didn t just go with the usual talking points.

Then he decided he had to amend that to say such savings might be nothing to a family earning $600,000 per year (true), or for people living in New York or California (false).Those are the same two states that Trump s loyal subjects insist on stripping from the 2016 vote totals to claim that Trump actually won the popular vote.

 Bad News For Trump â€” Mitch McConnell Says No To Repealing Obamacare In 2018,"Republicans have had seven years to come up with a viable replacement for Obamacare but they failed miserably. After taking a victory lap for gifting the wealthy with a tax break on Wednesday, Donald Trump looked at the cameras and said,  We have essentially repealed Obamacare and we will come up with something that will be much better. Obamacare has been repealed in this bill,  he added. Well, like most things Trump says, that s just not true. But, if the former reality show star could have done that in order to eradicate former President Obama s signature legislation, he would have and without offering an alternative.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told NPR that  This has not been a very bipartisan year. I hope in the new year, we re going to pivot here and become more cooperative. An Obamacare repeal in 2018 is DOA. Well, we obviously were unable to completely repeal and replace with a 52-48 Senate,  the Kentucky Republican said.  We ll have to take a look at what that looks like with a 51-49 Senate. But I think we ll probably move on to other issues. NPR reports:McConnell hopes to focus instead on stabilizing the insurance marketplaces to keep premiums from skyrocketing in the early months of 2018, a promise he made to moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine to get her support for the tax bill.On top of that McConnell broke with House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., on the approach to paring back spending on programs like Medicaid and food stamps. McConnell told NPR he is  not interested  in using Senate budget rules to allow Republicans to cut entitlements without consultation with Democrats. I think entitlement changes, to be sustained, almost always have to be bipartisan,  McConnell said.  The House may have a different agenda. If our Democratic friends in the Senate want to join us to tackle any kind of entitlement reform. I d be happy to take a look at it. This is coming from Mitch McConnell. He knows Donald Trump is destroying the GOP. It doesn t matter, Sen. McConnell. We still recall him saying that his  number one priority is making sure president Obama s a one-term president.

 Heiress To Disney Empire Knows GOP Scammed Us â€“ SHREDS Them For Tax Bill,"Abigail Disney is an heiress with brass ovaries who will profit from the GOP tax scam bill but isn t into f-cking poor people over. Ms. Disney penned an op-ed for USA Today in which she rips the GOP a new one because she has  always been cognizant of income and wealth inequality.  In other words, she is not Donald Trump, Paul Ryan or Bob Corker. Or Mitch McConnell. She is Abigail Disney, dammit. Since the election of Ronald Reagan, the gap between rich and poor has grown dramatically and  trickle down  economics has turned out to cause more of a trickle up,  she writes.  But nothing has brought the problem of inequality into sharper focus for me than the current proposals by Republicans to overhaul the tax system. Disney says that this proposal will be burdensome to the middle class while decreasing  the responsibility of the wealthy to contribute to the common good. And then she dropped a truth bomb. (We like truth bombs.)Republicans insist this plan will cut taxes for the middle class, but the truth is that any meager savings will be offset by losses elsewhere   in deductions no longer allowed, loss of Medicaid and Medicare coverage, and less funding for education, all of which are on the chopping block in order to provide a tax cut for a few very wealthy people like me. There is even a tax break to private jet owners. This bill will give me this tax cut while also killing health insurance for over 13 million people,  Disney wrote.  It will let me pass over $20 million to my children, tax-free. And all my friends with private jets? They get a tax cut too. With a suffocating education system, a dying infrastructure and a national debt that will be at least $1.5 trillion bigger, that social mobility will be far out of reach for people like you,  Disney continued.  But I will be able to stay comfortably right where I am. Does that strike you as fair? No, it does not, thankyouverymuch. But given how this bill was written, I think it s looking a lot like a nightmare from Pirates of the Caribbean,  Disney wrote.  Have I made you angry yet? I really hope I ve made you angry. You should be. No one who votes for this tax bill will be voting with your life in mind. But you will pay for it.

 Tone Deaf Trump: Congrats Rep. Scalise On Losing Weight After You Almost Died,"Donald Trump just signed the GOP tax scam into law. Of course, that meant that he invited all of his craven, cruel GOP sycophants down from their perches on Capitol Hill to celebrate in the Rose Garden at the White House. Now, that part is bad enough   celebrating tax cuts for a bunch of rich hedge fund managers and huge corporations at the expense of everyday Americans. Of course, Trump is beside himself with glee, as this represents his first major legislative win since he started squatting in the White House almost a year ago. Thanks to said glee, in true Trumpian style, he gave a free-wheeling address, and a most curious subject came up as Trump was thanking the goons from the Hill. Somehow, Trump veered away from tax cuts, and started talking about the Congressional baseball shooting that happened over the summer.In that shooting, Rep. Steve Scalise, who is also the House Majority Whip, was shot and almost lost his life. Thanks to this tragic and stunning act of political violence, Scalise had a long recovery; in fact he is still in physical therapy. But, of course, vain and looks-obsessed Trump decided that he would congratulate Scalise, not on his survival and on his miraculous recovery, but on the massive amount of weight Scalise lost while he was practically dying. And make no mistake   Scalise is VERY lucky to be alive. According to doctors, when he arrived at the hospital, Scalise was actually, quote, in  imminent risk of death.

 Mueller Spokesman Just F-cked Up Donald Trumpâ€™s Christmas,"Trump supporters and the so-called president s favorite network are lashing out at special counsel Robert Mueller and the FBI. The White House is in panic-mode after Mueller obtained tens of thousands of transition team emails as part of the Russian probe. Ironically, it will quite possibly be emails that brings Trump down.A lawyer for the Trump transition team is claiming that the emails had been illegally turned over by the General Services Administration because the account owners never received notification of the request and he s claiming that they were  privileged communications. In a letter, Trump s attorney requested that Congress  act immediately to protect future presidential transitions from having their private records misappropriated by government agencies, particularly in the context of sensitive investigations intersecting with political motives. Mueller spokesman Peter Carr defended the special counsel s work in a statement issued just past midnight on Sunday, several hours after claims of   unlawful conduct  by Trump s attorney were made, according to Politico. When we have obtained emails in the course of our ongoing criminal investigation, we have secured either the account owner s consent or appropriate criminal process,  he said.The words that pop out in the statement are  criminal investigation,  the  account owner s consent  and  criminal process. While on the campaign trail, Donald Trump asked Russians to hack Hillary Clinton s emails. After the election, Trump s team is claiming that Mueller obtained the transition teams  emails illegally, even though that s not the truth. We see a pattern here.Team Trump thought Mueller was on a fishing expedition. Turns out, he was actually reeling in the fish. The White House was not aware at the time that he had the emails. Mueller got them through GSA so that team Trump could not selectively leave any out if they were requested.Merry Christmas, Mr. Trump.Photo by Ann Heisenfelt/Getty Images.",News,"December 17, 2017",Fake
 SNL Hilariously Mocks Accused Child Molester Roy Moore For Losing AL Senate Race (VIDEO),"Right now, the whole world is looking at the shocking fact that Democrat Doug Jones beat Republican Roy Moore in the special election to replace Attorney General Jeff Sessions in the United States Senate. Of course, Moore s candidacy was rocked by allegations of sexually harassing and even molesting teenage girls   and being banned from the mall in his hometown of Gadsden, Alabama for doing so.Even before that, Moore was an incendiary character in Alabama politics, having been removed as Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court not once but twice, and having made statements such as Muslims should not be allowed in Congress and homosexuality should be illegal. Hell, he even said that the last time America was great was when we had slavery. Therefore, he was an extraordinarily damaged candidate as it was. However, despite all of this, Alabama is a deep red state, with many voters agreeing with some of Moore s more extreme positions, and some even insisting that the allegations of sexual misconduct were simply not true. That is why it was such a shock that Doug Jones pulled out a win for that Senate seat.Well, there is one entity that could not resist going all in on the fact that Roy Moore lost this race: Saturday Night Live. While doing a caricature of the results, SNL began, with its Weekend Update host Colin Jost brutally mocking Moore s alleged proclivities fore teen girls: Congratulations to Alabama s newest Senator   not Roy Moore. Doug Jones has become the first Democrat to win a Senate seat in Alabama in over 20 years. Said Roy Moore:  gross, over 20 years? Jost then got in a dig at Trump, for whom Moore s loss was  a humiliating failure, remind everyone what Trump said of Jones  win: The Republicans will have another shot at this seat in a very short period of time. It never ends! Indeed. If the sane people of America have anything to say about it, it will be a very, very long time after 2018 before the GOP is allowed to control anything. Jost continued mocking Trump: That s it? You just went all in for an accused pedophile and when he lost, [you re] just like,  well, we had fun! He could be removed from office tonight and tweet:  Congratulations to Robert Mueller on a great investigation. Had a fun time being president. Catch you on the flippity-flop! #DietCokeTime . Oh, if only that could be our reality, to have Trump congratulating Mueller for removing him and his entire treasonous, criminal administration. Until then, we ll have to stick to  Weekend Update  and the rest of SNL, and hope for the best.Watch the video below:Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,"December 17, 2017",Fake

" In A Heartless Rebuke To Victims, Trump Invites NRA To Xmas Party On Sandy Hook Anniversary","It almost seems like Donald Trump is trolling America at this point. In the beginning, when he tried to gaslight the country by insisting that the crowd at his inauguration was the biggest ever   or that it was even close to the last couple of inaugurations   we all kind of scratched our heads and wondered what kind of bullshit he was playing at. Then when he started appointing people to positions they had no business being in, we started to worry that this was going to go much worse than we had expected.After 11 months of Donald Trump pulling the rhetorical equivalent of whipping his dick out and slapping it on every table he gets near, I think it s time we address what s happening: Dude is a straight-up troll. He gets pleasure out of making other people uncomfortable or even seeing them in distress. He actively thinks up ways to piss off people he doesn t like.Let s set aside just for a moment the fact that that s the least presidential  behavior anyone s ever heard of   it s dangerous.His latest stunt is one of the grossest yet.Everyone is, by now, used to Trump not talking about things he doesn t want to talk about, and making a huge deal out of things that not many people care about. So it wasn t a huge surprise when the president didn t discuss the Sandy Hook shooting of 2012 on the fifth anniversary of that tragic event. What was a huge surprise was that he not only consciously decided not to invite the victims  families to the White House Christmas party this year   as they have been invited every year since the massacre took place, along with others who share those concerns.In each of the past 4 years, President Obama invited gun violence prevention activists, gun violence survivors (including the Sandy Hook families) and supportive lawmakers to his Christmas party. Zero gun lobbyists were in attendance. pic.twitter.com/QePW9FtbSh  Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) December 15, 2017The last sentence of that tweet is important, because that s exactly who Donald Trump did invite to the White House Christmas party. Instead of victims. On the anniversary day.Yesterday was the 5 year mark of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook School, which went unacknowledged by the President. On the same day, he hosted a White House Christmas party to which he invited @NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre. Here he is at the party with @DanPatrick. pic.twitter.com/mUbKCIWGxB  Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) December 15, 2017Wayne LaPierre is the man who, in response to the Sandy Hook massacre, finally issued a statement that blamed gun violence on music, movies, and video games, and culminated with perhaps the greatest bit of irony any man has ever unintentionally conceived of: Isn t fantasizing about killing people as a way to get your kicks really the filthiest form of pornography? Yes. Yes, it is, Wayne.Anyway, Happy Holidays Merry Christmas from Donald Trump, everyone!Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"December 16, 2017",Fake
 KY GOP State Rep. Commits Suicide Over Allegations He Molested A Teen Girl (DETAILS),"In this #METOO moment, many powerful men are being toppled. It spans many industries, from entertainment, to journalism, to politics and beyond. Any man that ever dared to abuse his power to sexually harass, molest, or assault women better brace himself for being rooted out, publicly shamed, and forced into early retirement.Well, unfortunately, the latest bombshell story has actually resulted in the suicide of a lawmaker. Kentucky State Representative Dan Johnson left a suicide note on Facebook and then shot himself on a bridge, according to reports from local authorities. Bullitt County Sheriff Donnie Tinnell reported to local station WDRB that Johnson s body was found after his suicide note from Facebook was reported to the local police. Here is that note:Now, nobody wants to celebrate a suicide. This man should have resigned gracefully and faced his accuser, who was a friend of his daughter s, who says that Johnson molested her while she was passed out drunk in his home. Apparently, Johnson, who referred to himself as some kind of  pope,  routinely engaged in parties with plenty of alcohol with minors. Johnson s home was called the  Pope s House,  and he was the preacher at the Heart of Fire City Church, where the alleged molestation took place.Now, innocent until proven guilty and all of that, but if someone commits suicide, it s likely there could be some merit there. That s a rather extreme measure to take. Further, by all accounts, this guy was no saint. He was heavily pro-gun, opposed any and all abortion rights, and has referred to President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama as monkeys on his Facebook page, among other racist messages and images.Again, we re not glad the man is dead. But, it is important for people to remember him for exactly who he was. We grieve for the loss his children, wife, and grandchildren suffered, for nobody deserves such a loss. However, methinks the people of Kentucky are much better off. Sad to say, but true.Featured image via screen capture",News,"December 13, 2017",Fake
 Meghan McCain Tweets The Most AMAZING Response To Doug Jonesâ€™ Win In Deep-Red Alabama,"As a Democrat won a Senate seat in deep-red Alabama, social media offered up everyone s opinion because that s what social media does. Democrat Doug Jones narrowly defeated accused pedophile and serial sexual assaulter Roy Moore in a special election for the Senate seat vacated by Jeff Sessions when he was appointed Attorney General. And some Republicans aren t exactly heartbroken about this.Take Meghan McCain   John McCain s daughter. She went right after one of Trump s biggest supporters Steve Bannon as soon as the election results were announced:Suck it, Bannon  Meghan McCain (@MeghanMcCain) December 13, 2017Three simple words. It s amazing what three simple words can say.Steve Bannon spoke at Moore s election night rally, which we assume was supposed to be a night of celebration. Bannon endorsed Moore early on, against Luther Strange, whom Donald Trump himself campaigned for earlier this year. Bannon s support for Moore remained steadfast even in the wake of multiple allegations surfaced against him of sexual assault, harassment and even pedophilia. Bannon even said,  There s a special place in hell  for those who refuse to support Moore.On Dec. 12, the people of Alabama rejected Roy Moore s penchant for pursuing, even assaulting, teenage girls. They rejected his hate and bigotry. They rejected an asshat who has been removed from Alabama s Supreme Court twice for violating federal court orders, thus demonstrating he has no respect for the rule of law. And they sent a message to the Republican Party that this bullshit will no longer be tolerated. If deep-red Alabama can elect a Democrat, then anyone can. And that should have Republicans scared out of their minds.Well, we re going there, along with Meghan McCain and anyone else who believed Moore shouldn t ever hold public office. Even Republicans have their limits, it seems.Featured image via Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images",News,"December 12, 2017",Fake
 CNN CALLS IT: A Democrat Will Represent Alabama In The Senate For The First Time In 25 Years,"Alabama is a notoriously deep red state. It s a place where Democrats always think that we have zero chances of winning   especially in statewide federal elections. However, that is just what happened on Tuesday night in the Special Election to replace Senator Jeff Sessions. Doug Jones, the Democratic Senate candidate who is known in the state for prosecuting the Ku Klux Klan members who bombed a church during the Civil Rights Movement and killed four little African American girls, will be the next Senator from Alabama. CNN has just called the race, as there seems no more GOP-leaning counties out there.To contrast, Roy Moore had been twice removed from the Alabama Supreme Court as Chief Justice for violating the law, and was also credibly accused of being a sexual predator toward teen girls. Despite all of that, though, the race was a nail biter, because Moore has a long history and a deep base in Alabama. Of course, decent people   including Republicans   were horrified at the idea of a man like Roy Moore going to the Senate. Despite the allegations of sexual predation, Moore also had said many incendiary things, such as putting forth the idea that Muslims shouldn t be allowed in Congress, that homosexuality should be illegal, and that America was great when slavery was legal. And that s just for starters, too.Thank you Alabama, for letting sanity prevail in this race. Oh, and a message to Democrats   this is proof we can compete everywhere. Get a fifty state strategy going so we can blow the GOP outta the water in 2018.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"December 12, 2017",Fake
 White House: It Wasnâ€™t Sexist For Trump To Slut-Shame Sen.

Trump was calling Gillibrand a whore.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders somehow denied that Trump s tweet was sexist. There is no way that is sexist at all,  Sanders told reporters.Then Sanders tried to explain what Trump really meant (we all know what he really meant). According to Sanders, Trump was merely accusing Gillibrand of being  controlled by contributions,  and hammering home his pledge to  drain the swamp  in Washington, according to The Hill. I think that the president is very obvious,  she said.  This is the same sentiment the president has expressed many times before when he has exposed the corruption of the entire political system. Sanders claims that Trump does not owe Gillibrand an apology if his words were taken as sexist. I think only if your mind is in the gutter you would have read it that way, so no,  she said.Watch:Gillibrand called on Trump to resign after Trump s accusers came back into the spotlight by hosting a press conference in which they called for an investigation into his past behavior.

We already knew that Donald Trump was a sexist asshole, but this is a new low, even for him.General Kelly, General McMaster, and whomever else is running that White House   DO SOMETHING about this fool s Twitter habit. It is way out of control, and he does great damage to the nation with ever 140 280 character outburst. This is outrageous. Forget the fact that the orange overlord is currently squatting in the Oval Office   no adult, period, should be acting like this.In this watershed  Me Too  moment in America, it is time to call out the Sexist-in-Chief for what he is   a complete misogynist who has no respect for women and never has.

 Accused Child Molesting Senate Candidate Roy Moore Sides With Putin Over Reagan (VIDEO),"Ronald Reagan is largely seen as the Messiah of the Republican Party. Despite how long it has been since the man was president, he has always remained the high standard of GOP morality for potential office holders. That is, until now. Reagan is likely rolling over in his grave at the idea of the state of his party with Donald Trump as its standard-bearer, and he s likely doing the same at the prospect of a bigoted accused child molester like Roy Moore (R-AL) being the next GOP Senator from Alabama. Well, now Reagan has another reason to hate Moore: He s clearly in the pocket of Russian autocrat Vladimir Putin just like Donald Trump is.During an interview where he s talking about Americans being the face of  evil  in the world right now, Moore indicates that Putin s harsh and murderous treatment of LGBTQ people in Russia is something he would like to see happen in the United States. Then, he does something most appalling, and goes on to give Putin a message in Russian. Now, no one knows where a bigoted, backwoods buffoon like Roy Moore would learn Russian. After all, he s barely left Alabama, where he has spent the last 40+ years wreacking havoc and just basically cementing Alabama s place as America s bigoted boil on the butt of humanity wherever and whenever he can. However, he managed to learn enough Russian to dog whistle to Putin in that interview. That should disturb us all. Not only is the man being a homophobe, a racist, a misogynist, and more than likely a child molester, he s also a Russian stooge.America, we can do better. We have enough Russian puppets at the highest levels of government.

Maybe if he changed his name to Hillary Clinton then he d get all the attention he needs.Pirro s hatred for Hillary Clinton goes way back and it appears to stem from jealousy.Maybe Pirro should heed the advice from Pirro in 2016 when she said,  We cannot have a country run by a president subject to ongoing criminal investigations, potential indictments and never-ending hearings [W]hether she s indicted or even guilty, it doesn t matter.

" BREAKING: Cop Finally Gets His Due, Walter Scottâ€™s Killer Sentenced To Prison (DETAILS)","In America, we have been having a conversation about police brutality against black Americans. Despite the countless black people murdered unjustly by police, there is usually no justice. Sandra Bland, Philando Castile, Keith Lamont Scott, Michael Brown, Freddie Gray too many to mention here, really. All of those people were senselessly murdered by cops who chose to be their judges, juries, and executioners, and they did so with impunity and without consequence. However, there is hope, and it is coming out of South Carolina, of all places.North Charleston police officer Michael Slager murdered Walter Scott, a black man who was fleeing after a routine traffic stop in cold blood in 2015. He would have gotten away with it, too, had it not been for a citizen who was brave enough to tape the murder. The tape showed that Slager had lied about his life being in danger, and it showed him cuffing Scott s lifeless body, and then planting a taser as  evidence.  Here is the news report of that damning tape:Thanks to that tape, Slager was arrested and charged with murder. Now, fast forward two years later, and Slager has been convicted of murder. U.S. District Judge David Norton decided to throw the book at Slager, and sentenced the murdering ex-cop to 19-24 years in prison.The original case ended in a mistrial, but the state of South Carolina seemed determined to get justice for Walter Scott, and that happened on December 7, 2017.  Of course, Slager s family begged for mercy from the judge, but luckily those calls were ignored. Michael Slager is a murderer, and he deserves the sentence he got.So many times, these cases end with the murderous cops back on the force, out in the streets after what amounts to nothing more than a paid vacation, free to murder another black person at will again. Thankfully, for once, the system worked as it should. For once, I am proud to be a South Carolinian. Hopefully this sets a precedent, and helps us turn a corner toward the arc of justice.Watch the video of the remarks of the Scott family below: Featured image via Grace Beahm-Pool/Getty Images",News,"December 7, 2017",Fake
 Watch: Is This Proof Trump Is Unfit for Service?,"New questions are being asked about President Donald Trump s ability to lead after he slurred his words during a speech about his Jerusalem decision. Possible reasons for this include: fatigue, a dry mouth (the White House explanation), the use of drugs or alcohol, a problem with his dentures or more troubling issues dealing with his mental or physical health. Morning Joe reported this morning that, unlike other presidents, Trump has opted not to get his physicals at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center.Questions about Trump s mental stability have been growing over the last few months. While he has never been viewed as a stable person in the traditional sense, his tweets and comments have gotten more erratic. He was widely criticized recently when he retweeted several anti-Muslim videos that were posted by radicals in the United Kingdom.One psychiatrist talk to MSNBC s Lawrence O Donnel about his impressions of Trump s state of mind.Many think that any degradation in Trump s mental state may be due to the increased pressure he is feeling from Robert Mueller s investigations into collusion between his campaign and the Russian government. This has increased since former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.All of this talk is leading to more people to ask if Trump should be removed from office, citing the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Rep. Jamie D. Raskin (D-MD) has circulated a  dear colleague  letter suggesting just that. As published in the Washington Post, it says: Please join a rapidly growing group of colleagues in cosponsoring H.R. 1987, the Oversight Commission on Presidential Capacity Act. It sets up and defines the Congressionally-appointed  body  called for by the 25th Amendment. Under Section 4 of the 25th Amendment, the Vice-President and a majority of the Cabinet or the Vice-President and a majority of  such other body as Congress may by law provide  can determine that the President is for reasons of physical or mental incapacity unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. The 25th Amendment was added to the Constitution in 1967, but in the last 50 years Congress never created the  body  that its language contemplated. Perhaps it never occurred to prior Congresses that setting up this body was necessary. For obvious reasons, it is indeed necessary, and now is the time for us to do it. While the Republicans in the Cabinet and Congress may not yet be ready to take this step, it is out there.Featured image via Andrew Burton/Getty Images",News,"December 7, 2017",Fake
" Trump Completely SCREWS The Middle East Peace Process, Just Another Wednesday For Him","On Wednesday, Donald Trump took a step no previous president had ever dared to consider. He has declared that the United States now officially recognizes the city of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and announced plans to move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to the holy city.The only problem is, the city isn t just holy to the country of Israel.While Trump indicated that he wasn t  taking a position  on any contested land, that s really a misleading statement, since declaring Jerusalem as the capital of Israel in effect gives the city to the Israelis, a position that essentially declares the debate on who all of the land belongs to over.Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator in the peace process, was quick to respond, saying that Trump had  destroyed any possibility of peace  and that he was  pushing this region towards chaos [and] violence. Mustafa Marghouti, an independent Palestinian politician, told Al-Jazeera that: This is not a single act. This US administration that did not speak even once about a two-state solution. This American administration did not say or mention the words  Palestinian state  once. This American administration has failed to exercise any pressure on Israel on the issue of settlements, although Israel has enhanced settlement activities in the occupied territories by no less than 100 percent since President Trump was elected. Many expect to see outrage across the Middle East as news of the decision comes in.The European Union, for their part, insists that their position has not changed, and issued a statement almost immediately declaring that they intended to continue working toward recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of two distinct states   Israel AND Palestine.Just as he does here at home, Trump seems to be uniting people against him, even some that seem to be unlikely pairings. Both the President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and King Abdullah II of Jordan warned that ignoring the Palestinian, Muslim, and Christian rights in Jerusalem will only fuel further extremism and undermine the war against terrorism. But the decision does make Trump s evangelical supporters in America happy. Their desire to hasten the end of days has been a constant source of bafflement for those seeking to understand the strange relationship between the Jewish state and evangelicalism. According to Christian traditions, the Jews will all die in the Apocalypse, as will everyone who doesn t share their specific beliefs.No wonder they re mostly Republicans.Watch Trump s announcement here:Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"December 6, 2017",Fake
 Trump Only Cares About Trump; Why He Is Recognizing Jerusalem Today,"President Donald Trump announced yesterday that he plans to formally recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. While this is left most pundits perplexed, the reasoning is clear. Trump wants to divert attention from Robert Mueller s investigation. It is no coincidence that the day after the news broke that Deutsche Bank has received subpoenas for information on the Trump family s assets, that this Jerusalem decision was announced. What could be a bigger news story than getting this information? A blow up in the Middle East.Look at the reaction world leaders have had to this announcement. American allies throughout the Middle East and Europe have asked Trump not to do this and have stressed how dangerous a statement this is. US News and World Report put this out today: The mere consideration of Trump changing the status quo sparked a renewed U.S. security warning on Tuesday. America s consulate in Jerusalem ordered U.S. personnel and their families to avoid visiting Jerusalem s Old City or the West Bank, and urged American citizens in general to avoid places with increased police or military presence. It is worth noting that while Trump will formally announce that the U.S. will recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital, there is no movement underway to relocate the embassy from Tel Aviv. In fact, he has signed an order to delay that decision for another six months. This move is necessary due to the 1995 Jerusalem Embassy Act, which mandated the embassy be moved. It also allowed the president to delay that by six months and every president since that act became law has done so this way.The Atlantic has even compared this decision to Trump  wagging the dog,  a reference to a movie where a U.S. president goes to war with Albania to take the public s attention away from his own scandals involving a mistress. The film was viewed as a parody of President Bill Clinton s military actions in Afghanistan and Sudan after he acknowledged an affair with Monica Lewinsky.While whether or not Clinton attacked other countries to distract the nation from his actions with Lewinsky may be a point that is up for debate, it is clear that Trump likes to do things to distract the public s attention. Catherine Rampell wrote about this tactic late last year in the Washington Post. She wrote: Welcome to 2017, the ouroboros of distractions, where every terrible thing is a head-fake for a ruse for a diversion for a misdirection from something else much, much worse. Trump makes announcements, sends tweets and says things without any thought to the real world consequences that follow. Experts in the Middle East fear that the Jerusalem announcement will lead to real deaths. Many people worry  that his thoughtless and impetuous tweets will lead to a nuclear war. His thoughtless comments confuse and enrage many.By making such a move, for such purely personal reasons, Trump is proving, once again, that he is not fit to be president of a condo association, much less of the United States.Featured image by Andrew Burton/Getty Images.",News,"December 6, 2017",Fake
 Watch: Trump Supporting Coal CEO Upset Trump Is Wiping Out â€˜Thousandsâ€™ Of Coal Mining Jobs,"While on the campaign trail, Donald Trump promised to revive the coal industry and after he took power, he signed an executive order rolling back a temporary ban on mining coal and a stream protection rule that was imposed by the Obama administration. Trump vowed to bring back thousands of mining jobs in struggling rural areas.  I made them this promise,  Trump said,  we will put our miners back to work. That was then and this is now.Coal CEO Robert Murray, a fierce supporter of Trump s, warns that if the Senate version of tax reform is enacted by the current occupant of the White House, he will be destroying thousands of coal mining jobs in the process.Murray said the Senate legislation will raise Murray Energy s taxes by $60 million a year,  notwithstanding the other so-called benefits the Senate has proposed,  CNBC reports. This means that very capital-intensive, highly leveraged employers, like coal-mining companies, will be forced out of business, with tragic consequences for our families and for many regions of our country,  Murray said. We won t have enough cash flow to exist. It wipes us out,  Murray told CNNMoney in an interview on Tuesday. This wipes out everything that President Trump has done for coal,  said Murray, the head of one of America s largest coal companies.CNN reports:Murray warned that a bankruptcy of his Ohio-based company would hurt its 5,500 employees along with their families. Asked if other coal mining companies could go out of business, he said:  Most certainly. Watch:Murray hosted a fundraiser for Trump during the campaign. And today, Murray warns that the GOP tax plan will  wipe out  coal mining jobs.Who saw this coming? Besides all of us. Trump supporters have been suckered.Image via screen capture.

" Sitting GOP Senator Has Had ENOUGH, Donates To Alabama Democrat For Senate (IMAGE)","Arizona Republican Senator Jeff Flake has never been a fan of Donald Trump or his incendiary, divisive brand of politics. Now, he is a leading GOP voice against electing Roy Moore (R-AL) to the United States Senate. Moore is an accused child molester, and has a lifetime history of making all kinds of bigoted and incendiary comments. He has said that homosexuality should be illegal, and that Muslims should not be allowed to serve in Congress. Moore was also removed twice from the Alabama Supreme Court for refusing to comply with higher court rulings. Well, Flake has finally had enough of his party enabling characters like Moore. He had already said that if he lived in Alabama, he d be voting for Democrat Doug Jones. Now, Flake  has taken his support of Jones even further, in the wake of the Republican National Committee s decision to support an accused child molester rather than a Democrat.Taking to Twitter, Senator Flake posted an image of a check   made out to Doug Jones  Senate campaign. Here is the tweet, captioned  Country over Party :Country over Party pic.twitter.com/JZMTaEYdxQ  Jeff Flake (@JeffFlake) December 5, 2017Now, I don t agree with Jeff Flake on anything politically, but I can say that he is trying to act with morality and decency here. One could argue that Flake s plans to retire from the Senate mean that he can do this without consequence, but at this point, that matters not. We do not need a pedophile in the United States Senate, and the GOP apparatus should be ashamed of themselves for trying to get Roy Moore elected. But, hey   better a pedophile than a Democrat, right?Featured image Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"December 5, 2017",Fake
 Republican National Committee: Better A Pedophile Than A Democrat In The U.S. Senate,"By now, the whole world knows that Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore (R-Of Course) was banned from an Alabama mall and the YMCA for creeping on little girls. He has been accused of molesting young girls as young as age fourteen. Of course, when the allegations first came out and the uproar and backlash began, everyone, regardless of politics, reacted with outrage. However, the GOP s outrage was often much more muted. Further, it took awhile for the Republican National Committee to pull their support for Moore, despite the deeply disturbing allegations of his being a pedophile. Well, now that the rage has died down, the RNC is back with a new message regarding this Senate race: Better a pedophile than a Democrat.Under cover of night, the RNC reinstated their support for Roy Moore, and an RNC official confirmed to The Hill that, quote, We can confirm our involvement in the Alabama Senate race. So, there you have it, folks. They literally want a child molester in the United States Senate rather than a Democrat. There are only a few voices from the right who are being brave on this one   and none of them are seeking re-election. Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney tweeted that the GOP must not tolerate Moore:Roy Moore in the US Senate would be a stain on the GOP and on the nation. Leigh Corfman and other victims are courageous heroes. No vote, no majority is worth losing our honor, our integrity.  Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) December 4, 2017Outgoing Arizona GOP Senator Jeff Flake has actually said that he would vote for the Democratic candidate, Doug Jones, if he lived in Alabama, and former Jeb Bush adviser Tim Miller has actually endorsed and donated to Jones.

Here s the video of Dent s takedown of Moore:There is also outspoken Trump critic and longtime GOP strategist Steve Schmidt, who went on national television and called Moore a pedophile:Other than that, though, it has been radio silence.

 Donald Trumpâ€™s Eating Habits Could Be Dramatically Affecting His Wellbeing And Our Safety,"We ve all heard the stories of Donald Trump preferring a well-done steak with ketchup and shunning any new delicacies, despite living a lifestyle that offers him all the luxuries one could ever desire, however, it s not just that the President has terrible gastronomical taste, a new memoir suggests that his diet is one of several poor lifestyle choices that could very well shorten his life.According to an excerpt from Let Trump be Trump, an upcoming book by Trump s former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and aide David Bossie, we get to enter the inner circle where the President of the United States having a 2,400-calorie McDonald s dinner is par for the course. Trump s appetite seems to know no bounds when it comes to McDonald s, with a dinner order consisting of two Big Macs, two Filet-O-Fish, and a chocolate malted,  is just one of the claims made in the book. To put that meal in perspective, Trump s dinner contains 3,400 grams of sodium, despite the American Heart Foundation recommending just 1,500 grams per day, plus enough white bread to last most people a week. Remember, this is just one meal, but it only gets worse. On Trump Force One there were four major food groups: McDonald s, Kentucky Fried Chicken, pizza, and Diet Coke,  the authors write about traveling with Trump during the early days of his presidency, but there may be a valid reason for it   Not only is he a fan of manufacturing, Trump is also a renowned germaphobe who allegedly won t eat from a package that has already been opened, which would also explain the plane s cupboards being stacked with Vienna Fingers, potato chips, pretzels, and many packages of Oreos.  Those well-done steaks make a little more sense now, as well. But a little bit of bacteria is probably the least of the President s worries. This is a 71-year-old man who gets next to no exercise (it s hard to include his golf when he barely even walks while playing), gets very little sleep, and is constantly throwing tantrums, so add in that diet and you have the perfect recipe for a heart attack. The diet alone, especially the snacks, is almost an open-invite for diabetes, too.What makes this frightening for the rest of us is that this is a man who is currently responsible for a nuclear standoff with North Korea, as well as dealing with rapidly warming oceans and an ever-increasing tax bill.

Being the Republican Senator for Arizona, some may have seen this as him just batting for his own team, but let s not forget that John McCain was one of the few glimmers of hope as he was also one of the only Republicans that has been openly critical of President Trump and this is a terrible tax bill.Not only will the new tax measures raise taxes on those earning less than $75,000 per annum, it would also take healthcare from 13 million Americans and raise the national debt by almost $1.5 trillion dollars over the coming decade! To add insult to injury, the 479-page bill wasn t even completed when it was released on Friday night, with some pages crossed out and others with hand-written amendments in the margins. Furthermore, nobody even had a chance to read it when they were forced to vote on it, but that didn t sway McCain and the bill somehow managed to pass the Senate.UPDATE: Senate Republicans are so desperate to pass their tax bill tonight that they're now making handwritten changes to their already handwritten changes Seriously. pic.twitter.com/KQfW7bOyk1  Senator Dick Durbin (@SenatorDurbin) December 2, 2017Some people had grown to believe that Senator McCain wasn t too bad for a Republican, but when he shocked everyone and voted in favor of the new tax bill, one where 13 million taxpayers will lose their healthcare but still subsidize his treatment for brain cancer, he proved he was no different and people decided to revolt. So when McCain put out the plea for another 74 followers to reach the three million mark, Twitter-users instead instigated a massive unfollow campaign using the hashtag #UnfollowMcCain, costing him hundreds of followers every minute.Over 5,000 people have unfollowed you since you sent this this two hours ago.One reason is you because you   a man undergoing cancer treatment   voted to strip $25 BILLION dollars from the part of Medicare which pays for CANCER TREATMENT.#unfollowmccain https://t.co/gWl6KsAaLE  Mikel Jollett (@Mikel_Jollett) December 4, 2017I m happy to report that @SenJohnMcCain has lost more than 10,000 followers since I posted the below tweet.

Bossert, who currently serves as Trump s homeland security adviser, then he forwarded it to future National Security Advisor Michael Flynn (now indicted), future Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, future senior strategist Stephen Bannon, and future press secretary Sean Spicer, the Daily Beast reports.With all the pearl-clutching we witnessed from conservatives about Hillary Clinton s emails, you d think they wouldn t be sending messages about Russia throwing the election to Trump.This past March, John Oliver, the host of the HBO comedy show Last Week Tonight started a segment called  Stupid Watergate,  which he described as  a scandal with all the potential ramifications of Watergate, but where everyone involved is stupid and bad at everything.

There is not a legal issue but rather a trust issue,  he said at the time.After Flynn left, Trump defended him, calling the disgraced former national security adviser a  wonderful man. I think he s been treated very, very unfairly by the media   as I call it, the fake media, in many cases,  Trump said in February.  I think it s really a sad thing he was treated so badly. When Flynn resigned, he apologized for giving an inaccurate assessment of his conversation with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak to Mike Pence, who, at the time, was the vice-president elect.Pence then said that Flynn had not discussed sanctions with Kislyak.The day after Flynn resigned, Trump, according to then-FBI Director James Comey, asked him to  let go  of an investigation into Flynn.Trump admitted that he knew Flynn lied to the FBI, then he asked Comey to drop the investigation.

He has also agreed to testify against Trump in exchange for leniency from Special Counsel Robert Mueller s team. The irony here is beyond delicious   especially since Flynn infamously led the  LOCK HER UP!  chants at the 2016 Republican National Convention, saying that Hillary Clinton was some kind of criminal, and that if Trump was elected they d be able to put her in jail, where many Trump supporters believe she belongs. Well, now the tables are turned, and it is Flynn who will be heading to jail, and the people who realize who the REAL criminals are have been having a field day.

 White House Panics Knowing Flynn Is Going To Take Them Down,"While Donald Trump has been taking vacations, special counsel Robert Mueller has been working hard on the Russia investigation. Instead of golfing this weekend, we suggest that the former reality show star huddle with his lawyers. Trump s former national security adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about conversations with the Russian ambassador and he s fully cooperating with Mueller. As part of the plea deal, Flynn admitted that he was directed by a senior member of the Trump transition team to make contact with Russian officials in December. In addition, Flynn is prepared to testify that Trump as a candidate, ordered him to make contacts with the Russians.This marks the first instance of solid proof that there was collusion between team Trump and a hostile foreign government.On Friday, just after the news broke, the White House insisted that Flynn s guilty plea will not implicate Trump or anyone else in the White House.The White House said in a statement that Flynn was fired for making false statements to Trump officials, and that he worked for the administration for a short time   and that he was a former Obama administration official. The false statements involved mirror the false statements to White House officials which resulted in his resignation in February of this year,  said White House lawyer Ty Cobb.  Nothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than Mr. Flynn. The White House then referred to Flynn as the  former National Security Advisor at the White House for 25 days  as well as  a former Obama administration official. However, the White House left out a few important details. President Obama fired Flynn as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency and he also warned Trump about Flynn during a discussion two days after the election and emphasized that he had concerns about him joining the national security team for the new president.On top of that, just after Flynn was forced to resign, Trump called him a  wonderful man  who was treated unfairly by the media.Photo by David Becker/Getty Images.",News,"December 1, 2017",Fake
 BREAKING: Michael Flynn CRACKS â€“ Will Testify To Mueller Against Trump Himself,"Michael Flynn, Trump s embattled former national security adviser, has reportedly caved in and will testify to Robert Mueller and his team about Trump s collusion with Russia. According to an ABC News special report, Flynn has pleaded guilty to charges that include making false statements to the FBI. Most importantly, he admitted in his plea that officials on Trump s transition team directed his contacts with Russian officials.Furthermore, according to CNN s David Wright on Twitter, there s more to it than that. He s reporting that Brian Ross, who reported for ABC News, said that Flynn also says he s prepared to testify that Trump himself  ordered him, directed him, to make contact with the Russians, which contradicts all that Donald Trump has said at this point. .@BrianRoss reports Michael Flynn  is prepared to testify that President Trump as a candidate   Donald Trump   ordered him, directed him, to make contacts with the Russians, which contradicts all that Donald Trump has said at this point.

He expects to put his house on the market. He is facing serious financial problems.  David Wright (@DavidWright_CNN) December 1, 2017For his part, Flynn issued a statement saying the following: Actions I acknowledged in court today are wrong, and through my faith in God, I am working to set things right. My guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the Special Counsel s Office reflect a decision I made in the best interests of my family and of our country. I accept full responsibility for my actions. The White House has said that this is merely more of what got Flynn fired in the first place, and that this will have zero effect on Trump.

 Trump Gets An Epic F**ck You From Britain Over His White Supremacist Retweets,"Donald Trump has a white supremacy problem, and now it is causing Great Britain, America s closest ally, to rebuke him in an historically public way. After Trump retweeted the leader of Britain First, a fascist white nationalist group, Prime Minister Theresa May decided she had had enough. She publicly criticized Trump, and made it clear that she in no way approved of his identifying with Britain First. May said of Trump s tweets: The fact that we work together does not mean that we re afraid to say when we think the United States has got it wrong, and be very clear with them. And I m very clear that retweeting from Britain First was the wrong thing to do. May went on to call Britain First a  hateful organization  that has caused division in her nation. Now, it seems that a so-called  working visit  that had been planned soon for Trump in Britain will now be cancelled.Trump, of course, instead of trying to patch things up in the  special relationship  that has always existed between the United States and Great Britain, decided to attack the Prime Minister of our closest and most important ally   again, of course, via Twitter:.@Theresa_May, don t focus on me, focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom.

 This Hilarious Campaign Ad Shows Voters How They Can Avoid Scandalous Elected Officials,"In Michigan, the upcoming election in 2018 presents voters with an interesting option: They could, for the first time, have an all-female  ticket  for every major office being contested. Senator Debbie Stabenow is up for re-election, and odds are good that the nominees for Governor, Attorney General, and Secretary of State will all be women.At least one of those candidates thinks that s a very good thing. Democratic candidate for AG Dana Nessel has produced a campaign ad that capitalizes on the benefits of being female when it comes to running for public office. Namely, the fact that she doesn t have a d*ck to wave at every passerby.With the wave of allegations over the last few weeks, beginning with the outing of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein as a total pervert and a sexual predator, it seems like everywhere you look there s someone else being ousted from their position or job for having at least acted like a pig   and in some cases the allegations are even worse.Of course, not everyone is suffering from the paradigm shift that has stoked bravery in women across America and around the world. The highest office in the country is, of course, occupied by a man who s been accused by at least 19 women of everything from sexual harassment to actual inappropriate physical touching. And the open US Senate seat in Alabama is currently being contested by, on the Democratic side, the guy who successfully prosecuted the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham that killed four young black girls, and on the Republican side, a guy who s accused of pursuing, dating, and touching teenage girls as young as 14 when he was an Assistant District Attorney in his 30 s.Dana Nessel wants to help you avoid all of that unseemly contact with potentially predatory men by simply not being one: [W]hen you re choosing Michigan s next attorney general, ask yourself this: Who can you trust most not to show you their penis in a professional setting? Is it the candidate who doesn t have a penis? I d say so. Watch the amazing ad here:Featured image via Bill Pugliano/Getty Images",News,"November 30, 2017",Fake
 Embarrassing: Watch Trump Attorney Gets Grilled Over Lying About Investigation (VIDEO),"The question as to whether Donald Trump is being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller or not was answered definitively by Trump himself via a tweet he posted on Friday morning. That s why Jay Sekulow, a key member of Trump s legal team, confused the world when he insisted that Trump is in fact not being investigated by Mueller on Sunday.While making his rounds on the Sunday morning political talk show circuit, Sekulow told NBC s Meet the Press host, Chuck Todd,  the president is not and has not been under investigation for obstruction.  After dropping this nuclear-grade contradiction, Sekulow was forced to defend his position to multiple members of the press. One interview, which aired on Fox News Sunday was particularly brutal for Sekulow. The show s host, Chris Wallace, qualified the reality of the situation well when he said,  Oh boy, this is weird.   He takes the action that [the Attorney General s office] recommended and now he s being investigated by the Department of Justice. He s being investigated for taking the action that the attorney general and deputy attorney general recommended him to take by the agency who recommended the terminations!    You ve now said he is being investigated after saying [he isn t],  Wallace observed.   No, he s not being investigated!  Sekulow shouts at Wallace.   You just said he s being investigated,  Wallace said.  At this point, Wallace is not putting up with Sekulow s inconsistencies.    Sir, you just said two times that he s being investigated,  the Wallace fires back.  And he s not just being investigated for firing Comey, there s also what he said to Comey when Comey was still the FBI director.  Sekulow then claims that Wallace is putting words in his mouth, insisting that he has been  crystal clear  about his assertion that Trump is not being investigated. Sekulow then tries to play of his contradiction as nothing more than him speaking on the  legal theory of how the Constitution works.  He then accuses Wallace of rephrasing what he is saying.Of course, this is all complete nonsense. That s why Wallace responds confidently, saying,  I didn t rephrase it. The tape will speak for itself; you said he is being investigated. You can watch the interview below. Featured image from video screenshot",News,"June 18, 2017",Fake
 Obama Shows Trump What A Classy Fatherâ€™s Day Message Looks Like After Trumpâ€™s Twitter Meltdown,"Donald Trump has been consumed with a seething anger and frustration lately that s slipping into everything he does. This week, his Twitter messages rose to an even more disgusting level of vitriol as the scandals and crimes his administration has perpetuated continue to come to light. On Father s Day, a time most Americans were taking as an opportunity to honor and remember their dads, Trump was on Twitter lying about Obama.The new Rasmussen Poll, one of the most accurate in the 2016 Election, just out with a Trump 50% Approval Rating.That's higher than O's #'s!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2017This is in line with what sources are telling reporters. According to aides, Trump is barely coherent, ranting at television screens and mad at the people investigating him.Trump advisers and confidants describe the president as increasingly angry over the investigation, yelling at television sets in the White House carrying coverage and insisting he is the target of a conspiracy to discredit   and potentially end   his presidency. Some of his ire is aimed at Rosenstein and investigative special counsel Robert Mueller, both of whom the president believes are biased against him, associates say.Meanwhile, former President Obama   whose popularity has only risen since handing the office over to Trump   put on a masterclass of how to handle a simple Father s Day tweet. (Hint: Instead of ranting and raving, try talking about the positive relationship you have with your kids.)Of all that I've done in my life, I'm most proud to be Sasha and Malia's dad. To all those lucky enough to be a dad, Happy Father's Day! https://t.co/ya1YAJignC  Barack Obama (@BarackObama) June 18, 2017The contrast is telling.

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2017Well, AM Joy host Joy Reid quickly destroyed Trump with a smile and some snark. Trump also tweeted about his poll numbers this morning, citing a new poll that puts his approval rating at 50 percent and saying that s higher than O s numbers,  Reid said before pointing out that Trump is obsessed with Obama.  Obsessed with President Obama much?  she continued.Reid then noted that other polls have Trump s approval rating much lower than Rasmussen. In fact, his rating is the lowest in history. The only poll showing Trump at 50 percent was Rasmussen, which Reid trashed. See if you can spot the outlier,  she asked the audience.Here s the video via VidMe.Donald had better see someone quickly about that burn.But it s even worse for him because his claim is not even close to being accurate. As it turns out, President Obama s approval rating on June 18, 2009 was 55 percent. And the polling firm that reported that finding happens to be Rasmussen, the same polling firm Trump is bragging about now. And last time I checked, 55 is still bigger than 50. That means Trump s claim that he has a higher number than Obama is totally false.Reid is right about Trump being obsessed with President Obama. Trump has tried to destroy Obama s legacy at every turn and he is constantly claiming to be a better president even though he has been a complete disaster for this country. Trump legislative record is laughable since the only bills he signs are minor ones that designate buildings and other little things that don t really matter. He has not signed a single piece of major legislation yet, and he is been in office over 100 days already.Mostly, he has been signing executive orders, which Trump and conservatives repeated whined about Obama doing. Trump is on pace to sign more executive orders than Obama ever did. Furthermore, Trump is also on pace to take more vacation days and play more rounds of golf in a single year than Obama ever did.Trump is an embarrassment to this nation and his poll numbers are only going to get worse once his supporters begin to truly realize that they have been duped.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"June 18, 2017",Fake

Let me be clear here,  said Jay Sekulow, a member of the president s legal team.  The president is not and has not been under investigation for obstruction. Sekulow goes on to say that Trump was actually responding to news reports of an investigation.Funny, because that s not what it sounded like from Trump himself. Surely the President of the United States knows how to be clear in his official White House tweets. The tweet from the president was in response to the five anonymous sources purportedly leaking info to the Washington Post,  Sekulow said, referring to the Washington Post s report that Special Counsel Robert Mueller s investigation into Russian interference in the election, now also includes a look at whether President Trump attempted to obstruct justice. He s not afraid of the investigation   there is no investigation,  Sekulow said, adding,  there is not an investigation of the President of the United States, period. Ah but Sekulow first said  He s not afraid of the investigation , that implies something else entirely. It sounds like Trump and his team are working to cover up an investigation and have it become hush hush and forgotten about.We all know Trump tells it like it is on Twitter,  covfefe  or otherwise. Trump doesn t know when to shut up or keep his mouth shut. Unfortunately for him there s only so much his team can do. Or try to do.Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla, also noted on NBC s  Meet The Press  that  one thing we ve learned from the testimony of multiple people now is the president is pretty fired up about this  and doesn t believe that he did anything wrong.

Al Franken, while not a newbie to most, is separating himself from the chaff, as are Adam Schiff, Kamala Harris and a handful of other Democrats. One major rising star, though, isn t a Democrat at all   he s a former counter-intelligence officer.

I got 31 death threats and that came from your website you gonna apologize to me? Marlow responded that he respected Nance and his service to the country, but Nance shot back by saying,  Your followers threatened my family, my children, my wife. The Breitbart chief tried turning the tables.  Are you really suggesting that Breitbart doesn t get death threats? That our lives aren t put in danger? Marlow claimed he didn t remember the story, but if Nance would show it to him, he d apologize. Apparently, Marlow hasn t heard of the Google.Nance responded that he will  come to (his) office and see that retraction.

 Newt Gingrich: Somebody Is Going To Jail Over Russia Probe But It Wonâ€™t Be Trump (VIDEO),"Former Speaker Newt Gingrich is convinced that  somebody  is most likely going to wind up in jail when the investigation into Russia s interference in our election is done, but he doesn t think Donald Trump will be the one who ends up behind bars. They re going to get somebody. I don t think they re going to get the president, but they re going to get somebody, and they re going to get him for something. And they re probably going to go to jail,  Gingrich told Fox News on Friday.According to Gingrich, what is playing out right now in the U.S. is no different than an old  western movie. This is like watching an old-fashioned Western movie. This is an Indian hunting party,  Gingrich said.  They re out looking for a couple scalps, and they re not going to go home until they get some. Special counsel Robert Mueller was already investigating Russia s election meddling and the possibility (or more correctly, the probability) that Trump s campaign was in collusion with the Kremlin. But on Wednesday, following the bombshell testimony of fired FBI Director James Comey, it was announced that Mueller is also investigating Trump for obstruction of justice.So far, Mueller has reportedly brought in 13 lawyers to assist with the investigation and intends to hire even more. Gingrich said this is a sure sign that somebody is going to have to take the fall. Mueller simply has too many  high-powered  attorneys to just go home  without a scalp.  Somebody is going to have to go down, Gingrich insisted.Earlier in the day on Friday, Gingrich had tried to claim that it is impossible for a sitting president to obstruct justice, therefore, Trump is innocent. Apparently, he forgot that as a member of Congress he voted to impeach Bill Clinton for obstruction of justice.Watch:Featured image via T.J. Kirkpatrick/Getty Images",News,"June 17, 2017",Fake

Only he is doing it in the White House every time a certain story airs.As Trump confirmed on Friday morning, he is under investigation for obstruction of justice as well as for his role in Russia s interference in the 2016 Election.I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! Witch Hunt  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 16, 2017That s right. Clearly, Trump is the leaker he has been complaining about all these months.As we all know, Trump s mental health has been a hot topic since long before Election Day. And now that Trump has been in office for five months, we can say for sure that he is mentally unfit to be president. Even the Army field manual says that Trump has no business being commander-in-chief of the armed forces.For instance, Trump has outbursts of anger and is obsessed with promoting himself. He makes unfounded accusations and attacks anyone who criticizes him. He lies constantly and makes promises he does not keep. He also lacks self-control and is incredibly selfish and hateful while taking paranoia to whole new level.And now we are learning from Trump s own advisers that whenever news about the Russia and obstruction of justice investigations appear on any television inside the White House, Trump stops and yells at it and rants about how he is the victim of a conspiracy.According to the Associated Press,Trump advisers and confidants describe the president as increasingly angry over the investigation, yelling at television sets in the White House carrying coverage and insisting he is the target of a conspiracy to discredit   and potentially end   his presidency. Some of his ire is aimed at [Deputy Attorney General Rod] Rosenstein and investigative special counsel Robert Mueller, both of whom the president believes are biased against him, associates say.Can you imagine being an employee at the White House just sitting there minding your own business and all of sudden this senile old man walks up and starts yelling at the television just because a certain story is on? That has to be scary and worrying. And it should definitely worry the American people enough to call for Trump s ouster. Trump should be in a retirement home where he can get medication and restricted television access, not the White House.Featured image via David Becker/Getty Images",News,"June 17, 2017",Fake
 School Employee Calls For Killing LGBTQ People At Pride Festival (VIDEO),"An employee of the Columbus City School system made a post to Facebook on Thursday, where they called for a  Boston Marathon like  attack at a local Columbus City LGBTQ pride festival. The poster wrote on the event s official page: I hope this event turns out like the Boston Marathon a few year s (sic) back. All [LGBTQ people] should be killed or at least relocated. Both the local police and Homeland have been made aware of the threat and are looking into the matter.A local NBC affiliate contacted the individual who made the post and questioned his motivations. The individual refused to say why he posted the hateful message and responded that they did not have anything to say about the matter. The school district quickly responded to the news by issuing a statement where they called the comments  inappropriate.  The school district released a statement the next day where they announced that the poster was being terminated from his position.    I can share that the District is working toward his termination. More importantly, we are gearing up for an even larger contingent of teachers, staff, students, families[,] and allies planning to march together at tomorrow s Pride Parade. We are expecting well over 400 people   upward of 500 now as people positively respond to the immediate actions we took as a District following this employee s unacceptable actions,  the statement reads. Despite recent legal gains such as the SCOTUS decision that made marriage equality the law of the land, hate crimes that target LGBTQ individuals have been on the rise. In fact, 2016 was declared the deadliest year on record for LGBTQ people according to data that was compiled by analysts. The report also cited the recent political climate as a major contributing factor in the rise. When Republicans are in charge, the queer community also suffers heavily.

 Christians Can Now Discriminate Against LGBT Parents Hoping To Adopt In Texas (DETAILS),"It is now possible for religious adoption agencies in Texas to reject LGBT+ parents from adopting children.The Daily Caller reports that Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed a bill on Thursday allowing faith-based foster care and adoption agencies to deny LGBT parents. This law, HB 3859, effectively protects faith-based agencies from being sued for choosing not to place children with any sort of LGBT+ couples.First of all, why is religion even playing a role in adoption? Children need a loving home and if parents are able to provide it, why does it matter who they are or who they re with? LGBT+ parents are just as capable as heterosexual, cisgender couples.Democratic opponents of the bill pointed out that it s a redundant law but supposedly it s a  step further  in preventing a couple from suing a faith-based agency if they re rejected. They also believe that it may allow for the use of religion as a tool of discrimination against LGBT and non-Christian parents. Such an imbalance of rights not only could leave these children worse off than they are now, it opens the door to blatant discrimination against children and loving parents who might not share the same beliefs as some foster care providers,  Democratic State Sen. Kirk Watson said when the bill was brought before the state Senate. Of course, it s going to be used as a tool of discrimination! Why else was this bill written up? Certainly not for the welfare of the children.According to The Daily Caller, the author of the bill State Rep. James Frank, claims it would not only defend the rights of religious agencies but also help solve the housing crisis that plagues the foster and adoption systems.Republicans argue it s necessary to prevent the loss of faith-based agencies where some have already ceased operations due to the risk of being sued for operating according to their religious beliefs.You think?Again, I ask, why is religion even involved in the foster care system? It s an outrage and it s disgusting. It s another tarnish to the Christian faith.Featured image via Rodger Mallison/Fort Worth Star-Telegram/TNS via Getty Images",News,"June 16, 2017",Fake
" Trump RUNS SCARED From Russia Investigation, Hires ANOTHER High Profile Lawyer","Donald Trump s Russia problem just won t go away. In fact, the investigation is steadily expanding, and with the revelation that Trump himself is now personally under criminal investigation, Trump s number two man, Mike Pence, has hired his own lawyer. There are also reports that one of Trump s own lawyers, Michael Cohen, has lawyered up as well. Of course, there was also the revelation that Trump s own son-in-law and top adviser, Jared Kushner, is also under federal investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller for potential financial crimes. Now, it seems that Trump is more nervous than ever, and seems to believe that his own long-time civil litigation lawyer, Marc Kasowitcz, is no longer enough. Trump has now retained John Dowd, a high-profile attorney who has represented the likes of Senator John McCain (R-AZ).This addition is a major development. Dowd is experienced with keeping corrupt politicians out of jail. He is 76 years old and the ultimate Washington insider. This means that Trump s legal troubles are mounting, and the White House knows it. Dowd joins an already beefy team. In addition to Dowd and Kasowitz, Trump has also retained Mark Bowe and Jay Sekulow.Now, this is a risky move for someone as distinguished as John Dowd. Trump s intemperate Twitter rants and revealing public statements would make him an almost impossible to manage client. His own incriminating statements, along with his penchant for refusing to pay his bills have already made many high-powered Washington law firms to turn down the opportunity to represent the man baby  president.  Granted, the guy is getting up in age and already has a long career behind him. Perhaps he is not afraid of taking what is sure to be a losing case due to Trump s own foolish words and actions.Either way, this Russia investigation is no longer just smoke. There s fire there as well, and the people around Trump and in the White House know it. It would be a prudent decision for every single person working in the West Wing to lawyer up STAT, unless they want to spend the rest of their miserable lives in federal prison   which is likely where many   if not all   of them belong.Featured image via Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images",News,"June 16, 2017",Fake
 Trumpâ€™s Personal Lawyer Just Made A Major Legal Move Preparing For Russia Investigation,"Donald Trump s longtime personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, has hired legal counsel amidst an intensifying investigation into Russia s possible interference in the 2016 election. MSNBC s Katy Tur broke the story when she tweeted out that Stephen M. Ryan, a lawyer with McDermott, Will & Emery, will be advising Cohen during the investigation, which is being headed by former FBI director Robert Mueller. Mueller himself just hired 13 more lawyers for the probe.Exclusive: Trump personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, has hired his own counsel: Stephen Ryan, of McDermott, Will & Emery.- source w knowledge  Katy Tur (@KatyTurNBC) June 16, 2017Tur revealed that Cohen will speak in front of the House Intelligence Committee on September 5th. Tur also recently reported that former Trump campaign communications advisor, Michael Caputo, was contacted by the FBI and subsequently asked to speak before the House Intelligence Committee on a voluntary basis. It should be noted that Cohen worked for a Russian media company supportive of Vladimir Putin in the 1990s.Inside the White House, it was revealed on Thursday that Vice President Mike Pence has also lawyered up with special legal counsel for the investigation. During a press conference in Miami, the Washington Post questioned Pence on his decision to hire a lawyer. He responded by saying,  It s very routine. Very routine. Pence s comment is a prime example of the flippant nature with which the Trump administration responds to questions by citing alternative facts. It is normal for people to hire special counsel to help guide them through the intricacies of a complex legal process. However, it isn t normal for almost every top member of a branch of the federal government to be hiring legal counsel in order to mount a legal defense showing they didn t steal their way into their executive positions.Regardless of what the FBI s investigation into Trump and his corporate goon squad that now inhabits the White House yields, the Trump administration has already hung itself in the court of public opinion, according to Trump s approval ratings. Between this investigation and two (and counting) separate lawsuits, Trump will likely sooner or later be found guilty of something by a judicial court as well.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"June 16, 2017",Fake
" White House Officials Caught Openly Mocking Trump, Administration In Free Fall (DETAILS)","Donald Trump s behavior and outlandish ways have made him countless enemies   and some of them are in the White House. Apparently, there s a lot of animosity over the fact that Trump s team keeps trying to do damage control and save Trump from the several federal investigations that are haunting the White House, and Trump continues to undo their hard work every day.This couldn t be more clear in the way the White House has reacted to Trump s lashing out at his own Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein, on Friday morning. The Daily Beast is reporting that Trump s team is so disgusted by this, Trump s aides and advisers are actually mocking him and making jokes about how they can get him to shut the hell up.In response to Trump s tweet about Rosenstein this morning, in which Trump said I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! , an anonymous  senior Trump administration official  reportedly joked: Has anyone read his Miranda rights? At this point in Trump s flawed presidency, we all know that the best thing he could do for himself and his numerous criminal investigations would be to remain silent   which he is incapable of. One senior Trump administration official even placed blame on Trump for bringing the obstruction of justice inquiry upon himself. That senior aide said: The president did this to himself. Another White House official shared that no one in the administration is surprised when Trump goes off the rails on Twitter anymore. That official said that for  all the heartburn and misery , they should expect that dealing with Trump s insanity is just part of the job now: If you haven t made this a settled factor in your morning routine, why are you still here? Thanks to Trump s erratic behavior, GOP insiders are seriously worried that he s not mentally fit to continue on with the rest of his presidency. Republican strategist Evan Siegfried said: President Trump has started the clock on the Rosenstein firing watch. This is feeding the private discussions in the GOP about the president s state of mind. As Trump s erratic behavior gets worse, we can expect more White House and GOP leaks as Trump s team turns on him one by one.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images",News,"June 16, 2017",Fake
" Hillaryâ€™s Campaign Account Hasnâ€™t Tweeted Since Nov. 7, And Now Itâ€™s BEAUTIFULLY Trolling Donald Trump","Trump and his minions and cronies twist reality so badly it s amazing they can even see straight enough to write anything pretty much anywhere. Yesterday, and into today, Trump has been going on about being investigated and screaming about why Hillary Clinton and the Democrats aren t. Today, one of Hillary s campaign accounts, @TheBriefing2016, decided to troll Trump a little over this. Their last tweet is dated Nov. 7, 2016.And it s absolutely glorious. It pokes Trump over the fact that he s under investigation for obstruction of justice, and possibly for other crimes that may include collusion with Russia. This is what they did:??? pic.twitter.com/uGXCchcW08  The Briefing (@TheBriefing2016) June 15, 2017They know the answer is yes, he s still here, unfortunately. He still has a White House full of possible Russian agents (possibly including himself), he s still trying to claim that he s completely innocent and all the facts point that way, and he s still generally making a fool of himself over both his  fake news  nonsense and his smear campaign against his  enemies. Two days ago, the Washington Post broke the story that Special Counsel Mueller is actively investigating Trump for obstruction of justice over his decision to fire James Comey just as the FBI s Russia investigation began escalating. Trump has called the Post  fake news  many times, and in his diatribe from yesterday and into today, he basically admitted that they re telling the truth about the investigation.Furthermore, one Democratic Congressman has drawn up an article of impeachment against Trump as well. The charge? Obstruction of justice.The funny thing is that the GOP keeps saying Trump had no intent of impeding the FBI s investigation when he s basically admitted otherwise. Paul Ryan also made sorry excuses about  he didn t know  when responding to Comey s testimony about his termination and his conversations with Trump during the time he served as FBI Director.We re pretty sure most of the rest of us would get convicted and thrown in jail if we said,  Sorry, I didn t know,  after breaking the law, because ignorance of the law generally isn t seen as a valid excuse. But Trump, because he s a Republican president and the Republicans are desperate right now, gets away with everything.Yes, he s still here. We re hoping that doesn t last too much longer.Featured image via Jason Kempin and Sean Gallup/Getty Images",News,"June 16, 2017",Fake

 Dem Senator â€˜Increasingly Concernedâ€™ Trump Will Fire Mueller And Rosenstein To Stop Russia Probe,"Donald Trump is desperate to stop the investigation into his dirty Russian escapades and even went as far as firing FBI Director James Comey, who just happened to be investigating him. Now, Sen. Dianne Feinstein says she is growing  increasingly concerned  that Trump might try to fire both Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is overseeing the probe into Trump s possible collusion with Russia and his obstruction of justice, and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.Feinstein, who is the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, laid out her concerns in a statement on Friday. The message the president is sending through his tweets is that he believes the rule of law doesn t apply to him and that anyone who thinks otherwise will be fired. That s undemocratic on its face and a blatant violation of the president s oath of office,  she wrote.Citing Trump s most recent tweets regarding the Russia investigation, which he has repeatedly called a  witch hunt,  Feinstein said Trump has  embarked on an effort to undermine anyone with the ability to bring any misdeeds to light. The Senate should not let that happen. We re a nation of laws that apply equally to everyone, a lesson the president would be wise to learn,  Feinstein said.Trump doesn t have the authority to fire Mueller. However, he can order Rosenstein to fire him. When Rosenstein testified before Congress, he said that he would only consider firing Mueller if there was  good cause.  But if Trump wanted to, he is able to fire Rosenstein and appoint someone who, after Senate confirmation, would follow his orders blindly.But Feinstein warned that this would be a huge mistake on Trump s part and would inevitably lead to a revolt of  even his staunchest supporters. If the president thinks he can fire Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein and replace him with someone who will shut down the investigation, he s in for a rude awakening. Even his staunchest supporters will balk at such a blatant effort to subvert the law,  she said.The similarities between Trump and Nixon just keep piling up. If he were to go the route Feinstein fears, it would be the Saturday Night Massacre all over again and would probably lead to the same outcome: impeachment.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"June 16, 2017",Fake
 The Army Field Manual Proves That Trump Is Too Mentally Unstable To Be President (DETAILS),"As commander-in-chief, shouldn t the Army field manual apply to the president as well as the men and women he commands?Because one psychiatrist brilliantly used the Army field manual to demonstrate that Donald Trump is mentally unfit to be president.Dr. Prudence L. Gourguechon wrote an editorial for the Los Angeles Times detailing how Trump s behavior makes him an unfit leader and she proved it by consulting the field manual used by the United States Army.After pointing out that the 25th Amendment of the Constitution has been getting a lot of attention recently because of Trump s behavior, Dr. Gourguechon said that after searching through  thousands of articles and books written on leadership, primarily in the business arena, I have found only one source where the capacities necessary for strategic leadership are clearly and comprehensively laid out: the U.S. Army s  Field Manual 6-22 Leader Development. That is particularly interesting since Trump is the commander of America s armed forces.Specifically, the manual discusses the areas of trust, discipline and self-control, judgement and critical thinking, self-awareness, and empathy. And as Dr. Gourguechon notes, Trump fails in every category.On trust, the manual states that  Leaders shape the ethical climate of their organization while developing the trust and relationships that enable proper leadership. Gouguechon elaborated.A leader who is deficient in the capacity for trust makes little effort to support others, may be isolated and aloof, may be apathetic about discrimination, allows distrustful behaviors to persist among team members, makes unrealistic promises and focuses on self-promotion.As we know, Trump doesn t trust people and he sows an environment of distrust. And let s not pretend that Trump hasn t made unrealistic promises or promoted himself.On discipline and self-control, the manual mentions traits such as selflessness, respect, integrity, and courage. If you are laughing, it s because you know that Trump has none of these traits. In fact, he is the most undisciplined and selfish person on the planet. Or at the very least the most undisciplined and selfish person who has ever lived in the White House. Without discipline and self-control, a leader may not be able to resist temptation, to stay focused despite distractions, to avoid impulsive action or to think before jumping to a conclusion,  Dr. Gourguechon wrote.  The leader who fails to demonstrate discipline reacts  viscerally or angrily when receiving bad news or conflicting information,  and he  allows personal emotions to drive decisions or guide responses to emotionally charged situations. On judgement and critical thinking, the manual makes it clear that Trump has no business being the commander-in-chief.A leader with the capacity for critical thinking  seeks to obtain the most thorough and accurate understanding possible,  the manual says, and he anticipates  first, second and third consequences of multiple courses of action.  A leader deficient in judgment and strategic thinking demonstrates rigid and inflexible thinking.The manual also makes it clear that Trump lacks self-awareness. It describes him perfectly. Self-aware leaders know themselves, including their traits, feelings, and behaviors,  the manual says.  They employ self-understanding and recognize their effect on others.  When a leader lacks self-awareness, the manual notes, he  unfairly blames subordinates when failures are experienced  and  rejects or lacks interest in feedback. The same goes for empathy.A good leader  demonstrates an understanding of another person s point of view  and  identifies with others  feelings and emotions.  The manual s description of inadequacy in this area:  Shows a lack of concern for others  emotional distress  and  displays an inability to take another s perspective. So if we go by the military leadership standards outlined in the Army field manual, Trump should be removed from office as soon as possible. He definitely should not have been allowed to take office in the first place. Americans need to take Trump s behavior seriously. He literally controls the most powerful military in the world, and the military would never voluntarily make him their leader if they follow this manual. That speaks volumes.Featured Image: Ralph Freso/Getty Images",News,"June 16, 2017",Fake
" Trump Just Went Back On Another Election Vow, Decides To Keep DACA","In a shocking turn of events, the Trump administration has done something good. I know that s hard to imagine while Trump has been working to crackdown on immigration.According to the Washington Post, the Trump administration is leaving in place the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, a program protecting hundreds of thousands young immigrants from deportation. It s also the very same program Trump had pledged to eliminate as a presidential candidate.Crazy, right?Referred to as  dreamers,  these young immigrants arrived in the U.S. as small children and raised in the U.S. For them there is no recollection of their former home country. To protect these young immigrants from deportation to a land they do not know, the DACA program was launched in 2012 and has since protected about 787,000 young immigrants from deportation.Despite Trump s vow, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly quietly announced the decision to keep the program at the bottom of a fact sheet released late Thursday.Of course, there s a caveat to this program remaining in place. In the fact sheet, Kelly declared the end to Deferred Action for Parents of Americans, or DAPA, a similar, but never implemented program intended to shield immigrant parents of U.S. citizens and legal residents from deportation.No idea what made Trump and his administration change their mind on DACA but thankfully Obama s program will remain in place for young immigrants.Unfortunately, that s not the case for parents.DAPA was blocked by a federal judge in Texas after 26 states sued. The Washington Post goes on to say that  Republicans saw it as a  backdoor amnesty  and argued that Obama overstepped his authority by protecting a specific class of immigrants living in the United States illegally. Trump did mention in an Associated Press interview in April that his administration is  not after the dreamers, we are after the criminals  and  The Dreamers should rest easy. If that s the case, the question then becomes: why block it for parents? If they re not criminals, why shouldn t they get protection, too?Though we have a win, there s still much work to be done.Featured image via Diego G Diaz/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images",News,"June 16, 2017",Fake
" Kellyanne Conway Launches Into Bizarre Rant Against Democrats, Imagines Her Own Death (VIDEO)","While America is still recovering from the shocking shooting that occurred at a Republican baseball game in which Rep. Steve Scalise and four others were injured, many conservatives are still using the shooting as a way to promote division within America.Many Republicans were quick to place blame on the Democratic party, and today Donald Trump s White House adviser Kellyanne Conway jumped at the opportunity to strengthen those accusations. In an appearance on Fox & Friends, Conway trashed the media and Democrats for criticizing Trump at the time of the shooting, arguing that it was Democrats who were creating division in the country by refusing to praise Trump for his poor performance as POTUS. Conway said: I went back and looked at exactly what was being discussed on all the TV shows, except yours, at 7:09 a.m. on Wednesday, when this happened, and it s a really curious exercise, because as Steve Scalise was fighting for his life and crawling into right field in a trail of blood, you should go back and see what people were saying about the president and Republicans at that very moment. Of course, they had to break in with the news of this tragedy, and since then there s been some introspection   some quieter, more muted voices toning down the rhetoric. Then, Conway s rant got even more strange. Still trying to pretend that her boss isn t the source of a good portion of the hate and division we are seeing in America today, she tried to give the bizarre example of her own death to make her point. She said: But look at Twitter. If I was shot and killed tomorrow, half of Twitter would explode in applause and excitement   this is the world we live in now. Well, according to Trump himself, he could technically shoot Conway on a busy street in New York and get away with it   as he once bragged about. So for Conway to be blaming Democrats for the tension that our current Republican POTUS has created is beyond unfair and misguided.While many Republicans were blaming the opposite party, Democrats were praying and sending supportive messages in solidarity with their GOP colleagues   disproving Conway s accusations entirely. You can watch Conway s ridiculous rant below.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"June 16, 2017",Fake
 Trump Gets His A** Handed To Him After Whining About Russia Investigation Like A Frightened Schoolboy,"Donald Trump is definitely protesting too much.This would be a good time for Trump to keep his mouth shut, but as usual, he s not.When top law firms refused to work for him on this case, they did so for precisely this reason. Having a client who constantly sets fires with his mouth is not a client any lawyer wants to put up with. They would prefer Trump exercise his right to remain silent. After all, we have that right for a reason.But Trump has been obsessed with whining about the Russia investigation and the obstruction of justice investigation led by special investigator Robert Mueller. Trump was recently talked out of firing him by his aides. So he has resorted to attacks on social media.On Friday morning, Trump resumed complaining.After 7 months of investigations & committee hearings about my  collusion with the Russians,  nobody has been able to show any proof.

 Trump Hires Sonâ€™s Wedding Planner To Run New York Housing Department,"Here s something you might want to send to your nearest Trump supporting family member the next time you hear them say Trump is  draining the swamp : When it came time to hire the person who would control the multi-billion dollar New York/New Jersey housing department, he went with his son s wedding planner   a woman with zero experience in housing and who is currently mixed up in Eric Trump s charity fraud scandal.With the exception of Trump s golf caddie (who now runs his social media presence from the White House), it s safe to say that nobody has gained as much by Trump s rise as Lynne Patton. Prior to Trump winning* the election, Patton was an event planner responsible for organizing parties from rich people. She helped the Trumps host golf tournaments, organized upscale events, and planned Eric Trump s wedding.She has shown zero interest in public service, nor does she have any experience in housing or urban development. Her only qualification is that she is loyal to Trump. It appeared that was enough. Trump appointed her to  head up the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development s Region II, which includes New York and New Jersey, where she ll oversee distribution of billions of taxpayer dollars,  according to the New York Daily News.Overseers should probably keep a close eye on the billions she s about to get her hands on. Patton is involved in the  charity  golf tournaments that investigators say Eric Trump and his father used to skim $1.3 million from for their own personal gains. At the time, Eric bragged about hosting the event for charity at his father s golf course by saying it was great because the Trumps had donated the course for the day   in reality, according to a detailed investigation by Forbes, they were charging their donors major bucks for the  privilege  of using it for charity:In reviewing filings from the Eric Trump Foundation and other charities, it s clear that the course wasn t free that the Trump Organization received payments for its use, part of more than $1.2 million that has no documented recipients past the Trump Organization. Golf charity experts say the listed expenses defy any reasonable cost justification for a one-day golf tournament.Additionally, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, which has come under previous scrutiny for self-dealing and advancing the interests of its namesake rather than those of charity, apparently used the Eric Trump Foundation to funnel $100,000 in donations into revenue for the Trump Organization.Making matters worse, Patton appears to be a serial liar. In the course of vetting her, reporters discovered she had lied about at least two things on her resume. She falsely claimed she received a juris doctorate from Quinnipiac University School of Law. She also claimed she went to Yale, which, again, appears to be completely fabricated.Trump s obsession with stocking his administration with  loyalists  means he limits himself to only the yes-men (and women), hanger ons, and opportunists who attach themselves to Trump and properly inflate his ego. It leaves him with little choice but to pick from among the least qualified and most unethical people in the country to head jobs that would otherwise go to extremely serious and intelligent applicants. The result is this: incompetence mixed with dishonesty mixed with inexperience.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"June 16, 2017",Fake
 Russia Claims They May Have Killed ISIS Leader Al-Baghdadi,"Russia s Defense Ministry is investigating whether they have killed possibly the world s most wanted man, ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, among 330 other fighters in an airstrike on May 28. Al-Baghdadi s death has yet to be verified and this also isn t the first time the claim of his demise has been made.The claim comes after the Ministry said that their airstrike targeted an IS military council meeting in the group s de-facto capital of Raqqa in northern Syria. The Russian state-funded Sputnik news agency first made the claim of the possibility of al-Baghdadi s death when they published a statement by Russia s defense ministry that said he may have been present when the airstrike took out 30 IS commanders and up to 300 soldiers at the Raqqa meeting. The leaders at the meeting were discussing their exit through the  Southern Corridor,  the location of the meeting being confirmed by drone footage according to the Ministry According to information that is checked through various channels, IS leader Ibrahim Abu-Bakr al-Baghdadi, who was killed as a result of the strike, was also present at the meeting,  the statement claims, however, al-Baghdadi s presence at the meeting is still being investigated.Al-Baghdadi has kept a low profile and his whereabouts have been unknown for quite some time, however, he was believed to have been in Mosul, Iraq, before a US-led coalition began an effort to reclaim the city in October 2016. Since then the general consensus is that he had been hiding out in the desert. His last major public appearance was back in 2014 when he gave a sermon at a mosque in Mosul after ISIS took control of the city. During the sermon, which was filmed and watched around the world, he declared himself  the leader of his envisages Islamic caliphate. If the Russians can confirm that they have killed al-Baghdadi, then that will make the whole investigation into Trump s Russian ties a little more interesting, as U.S. authorities had previously offered a $25 million reward for information that led to his capture.Featured image via screenshot",News,"June 16, 2017",Fake
 Energy Department To Close Office Of International Climate And Technology,"In response to the U.S. withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement earlier this month, the Energy Department is shutting down the Office of International Climate and Technology, a department that works with other countries to develop clean energy technology.An agency spokesman tried to justify the Energy Department shutting down the office by stating that the DOE is  looking for ways to consolidate the many duplicative programs that currently exist within DOE,  thus the Office of International Climate and Technology is getting the chop.The 11-person office has been in operation since 2010, operating as a means for the U.S. to work with international partners on energy sector technology in an effort to reduce greenhouse gases. The employees of the Office of International Climate and Technology also play a large part in the Clean Energy Ministerial, a conference for high-polluting nations to focus on making the energy sector greener.DOE spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes said there are numerous international offices within the Energy Department that could take on the work of the Office of International Climate and Technology, however, she failed to acknowledge whether one actually would. The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) has an International Affairs team, while the International Affairs Office has a renewables team,  Hynes said.  The Department is looking for ways to eliminate this kind of unnecessary duplication   just like any responsible American business would. The closing of this particular office is most likely a direct result of Trump s 2018 budget proposal, which slashes funding for both the DOE and the Environmental Protection Agency, particularly cuts for climate change initiatives and research efforts. Naturally, environmentalists are horrified by the news of the international office s closure. Willfully ignoring the climate crisis is recklessly and unnecessarily dangerous for families and communities across the country, and it s clear that Trump will stop at nothing to completely isolate the United States and irreparably damage our reputation with the rest of the world,  said John Coequyt, the global climate policy director at the Sierra Club. Ignorance is not diplomacy, and if Trump were acting like a leader, he would know that. Hynes responded by saying that the Trump administration is not bringing an end to its clean energy efforts, drawing particular attention to Energy Secretary Rick Perry s support for carbon capture storage and nuclear energy efforts at a recent Clean Energy Ministerial.Featured image via Kevin Frayer/Getty Images",News,"June 16, 2017",Fake
 Bizarre Late Night Statement Proves Deputy AG Is Just Another Water Carrier For Trump,"Donald Trump s administration and White House is the leakiest in living memory. This is because even his own staff knows that he is incompetent, intemperate, childish, narcissistic, and completely unfit for the office he holds. Despite the fact that they all know this, the sycophants around him just keep on doing his bidding   and they keep leaking. These leaks seem to be worrying Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein   or rather, likely Trump s open rage with regards to them has forced Rosenstein s hand.Instead of defending the integrity of Special Counsel Robert Mueller as Trump and his minions have spent the last few days attacking this decorated public servant, Rosenstein instead decided to issue a bizarre statement late Thursday night that shows that he, too, is now shilling for Trump. The statement attacks the credibility of anonymous sources, saying:Americans should exercise caution before accepting as true any stories attributed to anonymous  officials,  particularly when they do not identify the country   let alone the branch of agency of government   with which the alleged sources supposedly are affiliated. Americans should be skeptical about anonymous allegations. The Department of Justice has a long established policy to neither confirm nor deny such allegations.Fired U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara pointed out that Rosenstein should be defending Special Counsel Mueller instead of shilling for Trump:Where is Rod Rosenstein's overdue statement responding to the President's repeated attacks on his appointment of Robert Mueller? pic.twitter.com/y7dwtWTQ4G  Preet Bharara (@PreetBharara) June 16, 2017This is beyond strange. The Department of Justice is not supposed to be politicized, but still the people therein serve at the pleasure of the president. More than likely, Trump ordered Rosenstein to do this, since so many damning stories about the Russia investigation are coming out on an almost hourly basis. Trump is reportedly completely obsessed with the Russia story, and still hasn t let go of the idea of somehow getting rid of Special Counsel Robert Mueller. In fact, the only reason Mueller is still there is because White House aides talked Trump off the ledge when he was about to order his firing.Conservative commentator Bill Kristol has an excellent theory as to what is going on with Rosenstein s behavior, and it s terrible for the nation:The Rosenstein statement suggests there must be a heck of a Trump story coming based on alleged information from anonymous foreign officials  Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) June 16, 2017In the Age of Trump, the independence of the Department of Justice is definitely shot, and this proves it. While it was clear that Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was a part of Trump s campaign and one of his staunchest supporters was nothing but a Trump shill, we had all hoped that Sessions  recusal from the Russia investigation and Rosenstein s taking over would give the whole situation a bit more credibility, but no.All I can say is thank goodness for Robert Mueller. Hopefully, firing him would be a bridge too far   even for Congressional Republicans.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"June 16, 2017",Fake
 Republican Satisfaction In â€˜Trumpâ€™s Americaâ€™ Takes 17 Point Dive In Just One Month,"According to a Gallup poll released on Thursday, Republican satisfaction with the direction in which the USA is heading took its biggest hit between the months of May and June in the time since Donald Trump took office, dropping a massive 17 points.While satisfaction among Democrats and independents also fell during the same time period, one and three points, respectively, the level of satisfaction among Republicans plummeted from 58% in May to only 41% in June. To add insult to injury, these latest numbers bring the overall satisfaction rating among Americans to a paltry 24%, the lowest since July, 2016, which came on the heels of a spree of killings of African-American men at the hands of police officers and then a spate of shootings of law enforcement officers, pushing the country to the brink. That s a pretty tough act to follow.The latest drop in Trump s satisfaction rating comes amid a slew of controversies in the last several weeks, especially his decision to abruptly fire FBI director James Comey, the man who just so happened to be responsible for handling the investigation into Russian interference in last year s presidential election. The fact that it was revealed that Trump may have also divulged highly classified information to the Russians only compounded the problem.What Comey had to say under oath at his Senate inquiry last week didn t help matters for the President much, either, such as the revelation that Trump had not only asked Comey in February to drop the FBI investigation into former national security advisor Michael Flynn, but also asked for Comey s  loyalty.  Fortunately for all of the United States of America, Comey instead promised his honesty.If President Trump can take any satisfaction from any of this, it is the fact that the previous six US Presidents also suffered dwindling satisfaction ratings of their time in office. Perhaps not to this extent within the first five months, but it did happen eventually.Featured image via Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images",News,"June 16, 2017",Fake
 WHOA: Ted Nugent Says Heâ€™s Changed His Tune On Violence After Virginia Shooting: â€œWe Have Got To Be Civilâ€,"Rocker Ted Nugent says he s seen the light after the Virgina shooting and claims he will stop with the toxic rhetoric he is famous for using to attack Democrats.In an interview with 77WABC Radio on Thursday, Nugent claimed that he has turned over a new leaf and  reevaluated  his language. He swore he will from now on refrain from saying  anything that can be interpreted as condoning or referencing violence. At the tender age of 69, my wife has convinced me I just can t use those harsh terms. I cannot and will not and I encourage even my friends/enemies on the left, in the Democrat and liberal world, that we have got to be civil to each other. Ted is famous for attacking Democrats with violent suggestions that could be thought of as threats. He has been particularly harsh on Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. He once suggested that the former president  suck on my machine gun  and referred to him as  a piece of shit.  He also disgustingly suggested that Obama should be lynched. He was very horrendous towards Hillary Clinton, especially when she was running for president. When making references to his guns he suggested she  ride one of these into the sunset, you worthless b*tch. Well, Ted, let s hope you are serious about changing your violent tune.

 Mike Pence Indicates That Heâ€™ll Soon Be In The Russian Hot Seat,"There has been a lot of social media speculation over what will happen if and when Donald Trump is impeached or he is forced to resign. The Constitution, obviously, says that Mike Pence will be made President. Pence, it s assumed, will be a slightly better alternative. While he s anti-LGBT and anti-woman enough to be the inspiration for the Handmaid s Tale, he appears to be just bland enough to be called sane.Not so fast. He might be sane, but if his latest move is any indication, he could be going down with Trump and the rest of the people who are in bed with Russia. He has hired his own lawyer for the apparent inevitability of appearing under oath.The vice president s office said Thursday that Pence has retained Richard Cullen, a Richmond-based lawyer and chairman of McGuireWoods who previously served as a U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia.Pence s decision comes less than a month after Trump hired his own private attorney, Marc E. Kasowitz, to help navigate the investigations related to the Russia probe, and a day after The Washington Post reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III is widening his investigation to examine whether the president attempted to obstruct justice.Source: Washington PostOf course, the act of hiring a lawyer in no way means Pence is guilty. What we do know, though, is that Pence knew from at least March that Trump s fired National Security Advisor, General Michael Flynn, was lobbying for a Turkish firm. Yes, there is evidence that policy changed because of Flynn s Turkish ties. Flynn had supposedly left that out when Pence was heading Trump s transition team.The White House, though, sat on that information for 18 days before firing Flynn.Again, hiring a lawyer does not mean guilt, but only three Vice Presidents have done so. Richard Nixon s VP, Spiro Agnew, hired one when he was under investigation for extortion, tax fraud, bribery and conspiracy. He ended up resigning, even before Watergate.Al Gore also hired counsel over questions about illegal fundraising. Dick Cheney hired counsel several times.The significant thing to note, though, is that none of the VPs hired counsel because their bosses were in trouble. They hired counsel because they were under fire. We can t be positive, but it s safe to assume that Pence will soon be testifying, and not just for his opinions.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"June 15, 2017",Fake
 Kushner Is Now Under Fire By Special Counsel For Potential Dirty Financial Dealings,"The Trump White House is now officially in full-blown crisis mode. First, we learned yesterday that Donald Trump himself is now officially under criminal investigation for potential obstruction of justice by Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller. What s worse for Team Trump is that Mueller is a decorated Vietnam Veteran, a George W. Bush   appointed former FBI Director who is the only head of that agency to serve past his ten year term, as Barack Obama went to Congress and asked them to extend Mueller s tenure. This request received bipartisan support. So, the current efforts by Trump shills to discredit Mueller are futile. His integrity is unimpeachable. Hell, even Republicans are telling Trump to leave Mueller the hell alone.Now, it seems that the cloud over Trump scandal-ridden White House is darkening, as it now seems that Trump s own son-in-law and top adviser Jared Kushner is now in Special Counsel Mueller s crosshairs as well. The Washington Post is now reporting that Kushner is under investigation for possible illegal financial dealings. Kushner is certainly far from the only current or former Trump shill who is under investigation for similar crimes. Others in the same situation include disgraced National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and former Trump 2016 Campaign Chair Paul Manafort, who is known to have had deep ties to pro-Russia Ukrainian politicians.Of course, we all remember the reports that Kushner tried to set up a secret backchannel to the Kremlin to avoid the detection of United States intelligence agencies. Combine that with the fact that he omitted the fact that he met with the Russians during the transition from security clearance forms   a federal crime   and we have some pretty big and definitive reasons as to why Mueller should be looking at Kushner.It seems the White House is not unaware of how serious all of this is; even uber bigot and Christian golden boy Mike Pence has retained his own lawyer to handle any and all questions and inquiries related the the cloud of suspicion surrounding the Russia situation.All of these people are dirty as hell. Time to get these incompetent authoritarians, corrupt goons, and Russian stooges out of our White House.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"June 15, 2017",Fake

 A Top Republican Really Just Blamed Obama For The GOP Baseball Shooting (VIDEO),"Rep. Steve King (R-IA) has been in the news constantly, and it hasn t been good. His most recent stunt will certainly raise eyebrows and even make people wonder if he wants to be re-elected at all, because it is absolutely ridiculous and pathetic.While many Republicans were quick to blame the Republican baseball shooting, in which Rep. Steve Scalise and four others were injured, on Democrats and Liberals, King decided to take it a step further. Reviving one of the most tired, played out traditions of the Republican Party, King blamed the shooting on former President Barack Obama.King made these comments in an interview with Simon Conway on WHO Iowa radio, where King actually had the nerve to accuse Obama of  dividing  the country during his presidency, therefore causing the shooting. King s comments are seriously disgusting, and reflect a GOP that is clearly out of touch with reality and ignoring the fact that it nominated the most divisive presidential candidate to lead the country   Donald Trump. King said: I do want to put some of this at the feet of Barack Obama. He contributed mightily to dividing us. He focused on our differences rather than our things that unify us. And this is some of the fruits of that labor. Unfortunately, Conway was more than happy to join in on the Obama-bashing. Conway said: Of course he also spent eight years telling us all how terrible we all are and what a garbage can America was and how unexceptional we all were. I agree. I absolutely agree with what you said. The GOP has been blaming everything on Obama for the past several years, and the fact that we ve had a new president for months now hasn t stopped them. King s comments are repulsive and incorrect, as he clearly cannot see the amount of division Trump has caused in just a few short months in the White House.

 Russian Lobbyist Blows Jeff Sessionsâ€™ Story Right Out Of The Water,"As Attorney General, Jeff Sessions is the top law enforcement person in this country. He s also under investigation for colluding with the Russians and for lying about it. Let that sink in for just a moment.There s a new report out on Thursday, which, whether or not it is to be believed, is more bad news for Sessions.According to an article in The Guardian, an American lobbyist for Russian banking and oil interests claims that he had dinner with Sessions. This is in direct conflict to what Sessions claimed in front of the Senate just this week.Sessions testified under oath on Tuesday that he did not believe he had any contacts with lobbyists working for Russian interests over the course of Trump s campaign. But Richard Burt, a former ambassador to Germany during the Reagan administration, who has represented Russian interests in Washington, told the Guardian that he could confirm previous media reports that stated he had contacts with Sessions at the time. I did attend two dinners with groups of former Republican foreign policy officials and Senator Sessions,  Burt said.Burt, who previously served on the advisory board of Alfa Capital Partners, a private equity fund where Russia s Alfa Bank was an investor and last year was lobbying on behalf of a pipeline company that is now controlled by Gazprom, Russia s state-controlled energy conglomerate, first told Politico in October that he had been invited to two dinners that were hosted by Sessions last summer, at the height of the presidential campaign.There are two ways this could play out for Sessions. Either Burt is telling the truth, which is a possible smoking gun for perjury and obstruction, or he s lying. While Republicans seem to be operating under the assumption that Putin is holding them tight in his warm shirtless embrace, the truth is that Putin doesn t give a crap about Jeff Sessions, Donald Trump or Paul Ryan.Russia s goal is to destabilize the United States using the best tools at their disposal, and right now, Republicans are their biggest tools. That will change the moment the idiots prove they re no longer useful. Burt s statement could, even if not true, prove that Session s usefulness is done. Russia could be ready to turn on the Trump administration.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images.",News,"June 15, 2017",Fake

" Republican Goes Rogue, Blames Trump For Baseball Game Attack On GOP (VIDEO)","There have been many reactions to the horrific shooting at a Republican baseball game this week, but the one that was just given by Congressman Mark Sanford (R-SC) is one of the most shocking.While many Republicans have been quick to blame Democrats and Liberals for the shooter s actions, Sanford went on Morning Joe today to point the finger at America s president, Donald Trump. Sounding like a Republican who might actually have a tiny grip on reality, Sanford argued that Trump helped create a toxic political environment, which may have motivated yesterday s attack. Sanford said: I think we have to watch out as a society because, if we don t watch out, civility is indeed a part of civilized government and an open political system. If you let these forces play out, I think we end up at a very, very bad spot. I think what happened yesterday was symptomatic of it. Sanford then turned his focus on Trump, stating that he is part of the reason America has become so deeply divided, and his rhetoric has undoubtedly had an effect on the country. Sanford didn t mince his words when he said: I would argue that the president is at least in partially   not totally   but partially to blame for demons that have been unleashed. The fact that you have the top guy saying I wish I can hit you in the face. Why don t you and I ll pay your legal fees. That s bizarre. We ought to call it as such. What I ve said back home, some of these people have been frankly weird and different in a town hall meeting. I say what is going on.

 Ranting Trump Accidentally Confirms He Is Under Investigation After Staff Claimed It Was Fake News,"On Trump s birthday, the Washington Post published an explosive story alleging that the FBI under Mueller s direction was currently investigating Trump for obstruction of justice for his treatment of former FBI director James Comey.The special counsel overseeing the investigation into Russia s role in the 2016 election is interviewing senior intelligence officials as part of a widening probe that now includes an examination of whether President Trump attempted to obstruct justice, officials said.The move by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III to investigate Trump s conduct marks a major turning point in the nearly year-old FBI investigation, which until recently focused on Russian meddling during the presidential campaign and on whether there was any coordination between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. Investigators have also been looking for any evidence of possible financial crimes among Trump associates, officials said.Trump has no one to blame for this new line of inquiry but himself. In testimony his staff hasn t even bothered denying, Comey noted that Trump once asked everyone to leave the room before directly asking the FBI director if he could find a way to drop the Russia investigation. Then Trump fired Comey when the investigation continued. Then he went into an interview with NBC s Lester Holt and explicitly admitted that he fired Comey because he wouldn t stop investigating his connections to Russia.Rather than make his problems go away, firing Comey and Trump s subsequent confession seem to have triggered a new investigation   this time in his attempts to obstruct justice by interrupting the investigative process.Despite the avalanche of evidence against him, Trump s team had a painfully predictable response: To accuse the Washington Post of lying. In the hours after publishing, Trump staff and friends repeatedly claimed there was no investigation into Trump. They screamed  fake news. The chairwoman of the RNC went further, claiming Mueller had smeared Trump with  unfounded accusations.  (Hint: Mueller hasn t even commented publicly yet. And an investigation isn t an  accusation. )Mueller's unfounded accusation against @POTUS changes nothing. There's still no proof of obstruction of justice. https://t.co/gY7pcfD4yj  Ronna RomneyMcDaniel (@GOPChairwoman) June 15, 2017Then Trump woke up and promptly confirmed it was real.They made up a phony collusion with the Russians story, found zero proof, so now they go for obstruction of justice on the phony story.

They said they would take a hard line on funding  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 6, 2017 extremism, and all reference was pointing to Qatar. Perhaps this will be the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 6, 2017 The nation of Qatar has historically been a funder of terrorism at a very high level,  Trump later said in the Rose Garden.  I decided, along with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, our great generals, and military people, the time had come to call on Qatar to end its funding, they have to end that funding and its extremist ideology. But that was last week. People change, feelings change, and why would the master deal-maker let some silly little thing like the War on Terror or people s safety get in the way of making some serious cash? That s why Trump authorized Qatar to purchase over $21 billion worth of weapons from the US, with the first part of the deal, worth $12 billion, being signed when Qatar s Defense Minister met with U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis on Wednesday. We are pleased to announce today the signing of the letter of offer and acceptance for the purchase of the F-15QA fighter jets, with an initial cost of $12 billion dollars,  the Qatari Defense Minister wrote in a statement on Wednesday afternoon.  We believe that this agreement will propel Qatar s ability to provide for its own security while also reducing the burden placed upon the United States military in conducting operations against violent extremism. The State Department doesn t see a conflict in interests with the deal, rationalizing it by pointing out it will take several years to build the 36 American-made F15s in order to fill the sale We are confident that Qatar can address its remaining issues within this timeframe, prior to delivery,  a State Department official said.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"June 15, 2017",Fake
 GOP Puts Together Secret Talking Points To Defend Trump; They Promptly Get Leaked (IMAGES),"The Trump White House is perhaps the leakiest in the history of the American presidency. This is because Trump s own staffers are sick of his erratic, lawless behavior, his intemperate late night rants on Twitter, and the general chaos of this White House. Now that the cloud of suspicion and scandal hanging over the White House due to the investigation into possible collusion between the 2016 Trump campaign and the Russian government to fix an election has darkened considerably over the last few weeks, the leaks just keep coming.The latest one is hilarious, because it was a set of talking points to deal with the news cycle regarding the revelation that Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller is now investigating Trump himself for obstruction of justice. What do the talking points focus on? Well, complaints about leaks, of course!A source close the Republican National Committee and the White House leaked the talking points to Washington Post reporter Philip Rucker, who promptly tweeted them out. They contain three headers:Here is an image of the talking points via Philip Rucker s Twitter: A source sent me RNC/Trump talking points for Repubs seeking to discredit tonight s WaPo scoop on Mueller investigating Trump obstruction  > pic.twitter.com/ctwy2si9A7  Philip Rucker (@PhilipRucker) June 15, 2017This is absolutely hilarious.

 Trump Still Isnâ€™t Convinced Russia Interfered In Our Election Despite All The Evidence,"Despite all the evidence otherwise, Donald Trump is still claiming that he doesn t believe Russia actually hacked our election. A report in the Wall Street Journal reveals that even though 17 intelligence agencies agree that Russia was behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 election, Trump still isn t convinced.According to the WSJ, sources say that there is a memo of conversations between Trump and NSA Director Adm. Rogers which detail Trump s refusal to acknowledge that Russia meddled in the presidential election. This memo reveals that the president questioned the veracity of the intelligence community s judgment that Russia had interfered with the election and also tried to persuade Adm. Rogers to say there was no evidence of collusion between the campaign and Russian officials. But On June 7, just one day before fired FBI Director James Comey told the Senate Intelligence Committee all about how Trump tried to obstruct justice in every way he could, Adm. Rogers said he felt zero pressure from Trump  to push back against allegations of possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Trump refuses to say that Russia interfered with our election for obvious reasons. Admitting that Russia did all they could to rig the election in his favor is the very last thing he wants to do.There hasn t been any doubt that Russia meddled in the election for months now. Way back in January, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a report that  pins responsibility for the election attack directly on President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, ruling out the possibility that it was ordered by intelligence officials or simply carried out by Kremlin supporters.  A whopping 17 intelligence agencies agree on this matter. It isn t up for debate anymore. Russia. Hacked. Our. Election.However, Trump just can t bring himself to say that. I guess it s too close to a confession.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"June 15, 2017",Fake
" After D.C. Shooting, President Obama Once Again Shows What Bipartisan Class Looks Like","For perhaps the first time since Donald Trump hit the political scene, he didn t make a bad situation worse by saying something self-serving and inappropriate in the response to the shooting of Republican Rep. Steve Scalise (Louisiana) during a practice of the GOP congressional baseball team.Trump said: We may have our differences, but we do well in times like these to remember that everyone who serves in our nation s capital is here because, above all, they love our country,  Trump said.  We can all agree that we are blessed to be Americans, that our children deserve to grow up in a nation of safety and peace and that we are strongest when we are unified and when we work together for the common good. Source: Chicago TribunePresident Obama, who still knows many of the members of Congress, also responded   with the class and deference we have come to expect. Obama reached out to Jeff Flake (R-Arizona), who was on the field during the shooting, and despite being on the opposite side of the political aisle, was a friend of the former President.Flake was among the Republicans gathered on an Alexandria, Va., baseball field when a shooter opened fire, wounding House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) and several others. Obama maintained a good working relationship with Flake, who flew out to Arizona with the former president in 2011 after the shooting of then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.). This is particularly raw for those of us in Arizona,  Flake told reporters of Tuesday s shooting, adding that Obama asked him to let Scalise know the former president is thinking about him.  He went through this a couple of times,  Flake added of Obama.Source: PoliticoOf course, many will question why Obama didn t call all the Congresspeople who were on the field that day and the answer is quite simple. He doesn t want to make it about himself. He simply wanted to send well wishes to a friend. That s class. Of course, it could also be that he is weary from addressing all the mass shootings during his administration.Featured image via Pool/Getty Images",News,"June 14, 2017",Fake
" Fox News FINALLY Tells Truth About Itself, Then Immediately Falls Back Into Old Pattern Of Lies","Fox News, purveyor of lies branded as  news,  has finally decided to drop the act and tell the world who they really are. In a fairly surprising move, they re dropping their  fair and balanced  slogan. The slogan was Roger Ailes  from the time the network was launched, but it s come under increasing fire for sexual harassment and assault allegations. The slogan is too closely tied to the worst harasser there was there Ailes himself so the network s management decided to drop it.And just when you thought they might actually be doing something right, they twisted reality again to fit their own warped view of themselves. The new slogan will be,  Most Watched. Most Trusted. Sure most trusted by people who don t know what facts are. When Roger Ailes came up with  fair and balanced,  it was because he felt doing right-wing news branded as such was a recipe for failure. That slogan had become the nearly-religious mantra behind their ongoing push of conservative ideology, no matter how outrageous (or, dare we say it, false) the stories were.Fox News has always seemed to be anti-fact because of that, and despite their  fair and balanced  slogan. But  most trusted?  In 2014, they weren t, at least, not among adults who had heard of them or in comparison to other networks, including CNN. However, earlier this year, Rasmussen found that more Fox News viewers trust Fox News than CNN viewers trust CNN.Maybe that s what they mean by  most trusted.  Of course, conservatives are allergic to factual reporting and so of course more of them would see Fox News as trustworthy.As for the  most watched  part? Their ratings have been slipping ever since it came out that there s a serious problem with sexual harassment there. At the end of May, Fox News had fallen to third place behind CNN and MSBNC for prime-time viewership. That was the first time in 17 years that had happened.So  Most Trusted?  Sure, if you re a right-wing nutjob who s allergic to facts, truth and history.  Most Watched?  That s a far more difficult claim to make. Maybe they believe they ll regain their top spot, and there s nothing wrong with believing that. But changing their slogan is probably only a tiny step towards convincing any sane person that they re capable of sticking to truth and facts, particularly with people like Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity still on the air.Featured image via Frederick M.

" After GOP Congressman Shot, Democrats Are Getting Calls Saying â€˜You Guys Are Nextâ€™","Hours after a gunman opened fire on Republican Congressmen during their baseball practice session, the partisan rancor began. Although we don t know motive yet, the shooter was a Bernie voter. He was also a psychopathic killer.While the shooter, who s been identified as James T. Hodgkinson, 66, of Illinois, died shortly after, it s not just one party that s receiving the wrath of unhappy voters. Democrats have been receiving threats all day, even on their personal phones.Multiple Democratic representatives said during a members-only security briefing that they had received calls after the shooting saying,  You guys are next,  California Rep. Nanette Diaz Barrag n told BuzzFeed News.According to Barrag n, more than one of her Democratic colleagues said during the briefing that they had received a similar call and other threats on their personal phones following the shooting. Barrag n said she did not receive one herself, and would not name those who did, citing their safety.One of the calls went to  a member who was not on the [Democratic baseball] team,  she said,  and other Democratic members expressed concern that they were getting calls saying,  You Democrats, you Democrats. Overall, there has been an uptick in threats to Democrats recently. Even House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said she has received threats. Rep. Al Green (D-TX) said he s received threats over his plans to impeach Donald Trump.Buzzfeed s article quotes several people who have received threats.While voters on both sides are going to continue to point fingers, it s clear that we have a problem in this country and it s bigger than guns. Anger, whether it emanates from Donald Trump s partisan and often violent rhetoric, from popular culture, or from the fact that people are feeling left behind by our leaders, is real. While those in Congress might be feeling a bit more unified today following these tragic events, the country is not. Congress can help, though. Republicans and Democrats can start working toward the betterment of the country rather than toward destroying the other party.",News,"June 14, 2017",Fake
 CONFIRMED: Special Counsel Mueller Is Actually Investigating Donald Trump,"Whether or not Trump obstructed justice in his interactions with James Comey has been the subject of hot debate ever since Comey was fired from his position as FBI director on May 9. Now, senior intelligence officials familiar with Special Counsel Mueller s investigation have confirmed that he s looking into whether or not Trump actually did obstruct justice.To conservatives who believe that obstruction of justice requires specific intent and a specific act, the whole idea that Trump obstructed justice simply by doing what he s done is preposterous. Nevertheless, obstruction of justice occurs when someone aware of a proceeding tries to interfere with it:[O]bstructions of justice aimed at judicial officers, grand and petit jurors, and witnesses. The law makes it a crime to threaten, intimidate, or retaliate against these participants in a criminal or civil proceeding. In addition, [it is] illegal to attempt the bribery of an official to alter the outcome of a judicial proceeding.Besides these specific prohibitions, the law contains the Omnibus Clause, which states that a person who  corruptly or by threats of force, or by threatening letter or communication, influences, obstructs, or impedes, or endeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede, the due administration of justice  is guilty of the crime of obstruction of justice. This clause offers broad protection to the  due administration of justice.  Federal courts have read this clause expansively to proscribe any conduct that interferes with the judicial process. The way that Trump communicated with Comey about the investigation into Michael Flynn and Russia, and then again in the way he so abruptly fired Comey and virtually admitted that he did so because of the Russia probe, could fall under this definition. All that s really needed is for the investigation to prove  that there was a pending federal judicial proceeding, the defendant knew of the proceeding, and the defendant had corrupt intent to interfere with or attempted to interfere with the proceeding. Prior to Comey s firing, the FBI had convened a grand jury in the Flynn investigation, which issued subpoenas for Michael Flynn s business records around the same time that Comey was fired. As CNN put it, the grand jury represented the first major escalation in the broader Russian probe.Mueller s office plans to interview various intelligence officials soon, which suggests that Mueller s views on the matter are more in line with the idea that he was actively trying to impede Comey s work, rather than just a disagreement between Comey and Trump about what was said.A spokesman for Trump s lawyer, of course, expressed outrage that this has made the news:The FBI leak of information regarding the president is outrageous, inexcusable and illegal. As we know, Trump and his supporters repeatedly claim that the real story is how all these leaks are happening and why nobody does anything about them. While leaks are a problem, they are not the main story. The Trump administration uses them as a deflection.It s not clear whether Mueller will actually pursue the charge of obstruction of justice. However, if he does, it will ultimately be Congress  decision as to what to do with it   not the DOJ s. And Congressional Republicans seem to be adamant that they won t impeach. However, if Mueller is able to lay out a convincing enough case, then Congress may find itself without any choice but to impeach.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"June 14, 2017",Fake
 Donald Trump Jr. Blames Scalise Shooting On â€˜Caesarâ€™ Actors And Gets WRECKED (TWEETS),"If Republicans were even moderately literate, they would know that the message of Shakespeare s  Julius Caesar  is that assassinating leaders you don t like is just bad juju all around. Everyone ends up unhappy in the end. Enter Donald Trump Jr, stage far-Right.Shortly after the guy who shot GOP Rep. Steve Scalise and four other people at baseball practice was revealed to be a Green Party person who voted for Jill Stein, regularly bashed Hillary Clinton, and who happened to volunteer for Bernie Sanders  campaign, Donald Trump Jr. hopped on Twitter to blame a bunch of actors. Events like today are EXACTLY why we took issue with NY elites glorifying the assassination of our President,  the tweet reads. It is, of course, referencing the  Shakespeare in the Park  production of  Julius Caesar. Traditionally, the play has featured various world leaders, including Abraham Lincoln, in the role of  Caesar.  In 2013, for example, the very same play with the very same script featured a man who looked strikingly similar to Barack Obama. He was murdered, because the play s plot largely hinges on the historical fact that Julius Caesar was murdered. Here is a photo of the 2013 Caesar:Conservatives said nothing at the time because it was Barack Obama, but when Donald Trump   the current President*   was  Caesar,  all hell broke loose because Republicans, as a group, are f*cking morons.Fortunately, the fine folks on Twitter were kind enough to let him know that he s too stupid to know he s stupid:The point of the play is that political violence is wrong.That s like saying we shouldn t watch Saving Private Ryan or it ll lead to war.

 Rand Paul Forgot To Delete Tweet Calling For People To Use 2nd Amendment To â€˜Shoot At The Governmentâ€™,"In the wake of a mass shooting that left a Republican member of congress and several others injured, many on both sides of the aisle are asking that the partisan rhetoric on both sides cool down a bit. It s an admirable goal and one worth reaching for. However, it s also worth noting that the very same Republicans now suggesting liberals are inciting violence don t seem to have the same concerns about their own side.The calls to  cool down partisan rhetoric,  ironic as it may be, seem to be entirely partisan. One side   and it rhymes with treepublicans   aren t pulling their weight. The story unfolds each time this happens like clockwork: Liberals join with conservatives in condemning hate on both sides. Conservatives fall silent when right-wing extremists go on violent rampages, repeatedly failing to police their own.A prime example of this disconnect is Sen. Rand Paul. He was at the baseball practice when shots began to ring out. He was unharmed, but experienced the horror. However, his understandable desire to condemn political violence is not reflected in his Twitter history. Just last year, while a Democrat was still president and during the deeply-heated election, he passed along a message of encouraging political violence. Quoting a Fox News guest, Paul wrote:.@Judgenap: Why do we have a Second Amendment? It's not to shoot deer. It's to shoot at the government when it becomes tyrannical!  Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) June 23, 2016Amazingly, he never bothered to delete the tweet. (We took screenshots in case he decides to now.)The political climate of June 2016 was, in some ways, even more heated than it is now. By that point in Obama s presidency, it had become clear that the right s boogieman was not going to be impeached and that his two terms in office had been overwhelming successful. Confronted with that reality, conservatives grew hysterical. Even in the months before he left office, Obama was being labeled by right-wing media as  tyrannical. Here s how The Federalist, a so-called  intellectual  right-wing outlet, was describing Obama just months before Rand s tweet:The year before, Sen. Ted Cruz and Texas Governor Greg Abbott were seriously suggesting that Obama might invade Texas and enact a martial law program named  Jade Helm  to confiscate Texans  guns. The allegations were patently absurd, but they riled up many conservatives who suddenly became terrified that the government was about to round them up and put them in detention camps. (Trump s friend Alex Jones helped promote the idea, going so far as claim to have identified several locations where the military was setting up internment areas.)Rand Paul isn t the only one to blame here. Fox News, which today is making blanket, factless statements about the  violence  of liberals, was responsible for the original comment by Judge Napolitano, a longtime contributor to the network and full-time nutjob. Nobody batted an eye when he encouraged people to lash out at the  tyrannical  government with guns. Fox was being viewed by millions of people a day, all being told relentlessly that Obama was acting like a dictator. They could connect the dots.In conclusion: Spare the indignation, conservatives. While we can all agree that violence has no place in the political discourse, that only works if both sides are operating in good faith. So far, Republicans have not shown an ability to condemn their own violent extremists the way they have asked liberals to do. Without that equal shouldering of the responsibility there can be no true change in the political climate.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"June 14, 2017",Fake
" Kellyanne Conway, Trump Jr. Spread False Info About Capitol Shooter To Blame It On Liberals","It took Trump s family and friends under an hour after a mass shooting at a congressional Republican baseball practice to win the awards for  Worst Reaction to a Mass Shooting.  And sadly, many Trump voters appear to be eating it up.Both Kellyanne Conway and Donald Trump Jr. managed to promote unsubstantiated and largely debunked information coming out to push a narrative that the shooter had targeted Republicans and not Democrats. The reality is: Nobody knows why the shooter did it. Not yet.Don and Kellyanne both used a single source: Rep. Jeff Duncan, whose narrative began coming to pieces shortly after he had made the comment.The man Duncan and other Republicans described as having asked whether the people playing baseball were Republicans or Democrats looked nothing like the man who later shot at them, as numerous reporters began noting.The description of the guy who asked lawmakers if GOP or Dems was practicing and the actual shooter appear to be different people.

Drudge, in one egregious example, even misquoted one of the Republicans at the scene to make it seem like the shooter said he wanted to kill as many Republicans as possible. Breitbart and InfoWars both quickly joined in. No such words were said.The White House released a statement saying the president had been  briefed  on the situation, but it s unclear what his briefing looked like. Trump gets much of his news from Drudge, Breitbart and Fox News. It s entirely possible that the President of the United States believes the lies being spread by right-wing media and his advisors.At this time no one knows the true motives of the shooter. Police have him in custody and, unlike Trump s son, are conducting a thorough investigation before blasting out unsubstantiated reports into the public. Rather than waiting, the right-wing media and Trump s own White House decided to exploit the tragedy in order to further their agenda of smearing liberals. It s beyond maddening to watch the group who once called President Obama  divisive  for expressing sorrow for Trayvon Martin now openly and gleefully delight in spreading vitriol and lies about their political opponents.UPDATE: FBI investigators identified the shooter as James Hodgkinson.

" Workers At Ivanka Trumpâ€™s Clothing Factory Claim Extremely Low Wages, Abuse","Workers at PT Buma, the Korean-owned garment factory in Subang, Indonesia, responsible for creating the pieces that make up Ivanka Trump s fashion label, told in personal interviews with The Guardian of the horrendous conditions they are forced to endure working for Donald Trump s daughter.PT Buma started in Indonesia in 1999 and is one of the suppliers to G-III Apparel Group, the wholesale manufacturer for Ivanka Trump s brand, among others. Earning 2.3 million rupiahs, the equivalent of around $173 a month, employees bring home one of the lowest minimum wages in Asia and workers reported regularly working unpaid overtime while trying to meet impossibly high production targets. The management is getting smarter: they tap out our ID cards at 4 p.m. so you can t prove anything,  said Wilden, a 25-year-old male employee.Another clever tactic used is avoiding paying bonuses for religious holidays by simply firing the employees just before them. Indonesia is a Muslim country and the factory s management has been accused of firing employees before the holy month of Ramadan, only to rehire them again at the month s end. When employees are working, however, they are often referred to by derogatory names such as  animals,   moron  and  monkey  by factory management and suffer through what has been described as  violations of women s rights .When Alia, one of the 2,759 workers at PT Buma, was explained the general idea of Ivanka Trump s new book on women in the workplace, she burst out laughing. Her idea of work-life balance, she said, would be if she could see her children more than once a month.To make matters worse, of those 2,759 workers, only around 200 are unionized, split between two different unions. Of the non-union workers, around three-quarters are women who, like Alia, spend almost all of their income on their children, children they can t even afford to see, let alone even live with.Another such worker is Sita, 23, who will soon be terminated after seven months work and will receive no severance. That s one of the company s ways to cope with extra expenses,  Sita said.  I can t stand it anymore. I work unpaid overtime every day and still earn just 2.3 million [rupiah] a month. I m planning to move from Subang, where the minimum wage is too low. But I don t know where to go yet. I haven t got any connections. Don t be fooled, though, PT Buma factory workers know exactly who they are working for and they don t like it. Ahmad, an observant Muslim who works at the factory with his wife, as well as many of his other family members, said  We don t like Donald Trump s policies,  in reference to the president s Muslim travel ban, which he had been following on TV. But we re not in a position to make employment decisions based on our principles,  Ahmad said.These latest complaints come just weeks after one activist was arrested and several others went missing in May while attempting to investigate a separate factory that makes Ivanka Trump-branded shoes in China.Featured image via Clemens Bilan   Pool /Getty Images",News,"June 14, 2017",Fake
 Republican Senator Considers Obstruction Of Justice Investigation Against Trump (DETAILS),"Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, hinted at the possibility of laying obstruction of justice charges down against Donald Trump in a conversation with CNN s Manu Raju yesterday.Raju relayed a message to Grassley from Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat out of California, in the Senate s hallways. According to Raju, Feinstein  says that she wants the Judiciary Committee to investigate potential obstruction of justice. Raju was referring to a letter Feinstein wrote to Grassley on Friday in which she begged the committee to  investigate all issues that raise a question of obstruction of justice. These issues should be developed by our legal staff, presented to us, and be subject to full Committee hearings.  Grassley s response was one that we all wanted to hear. Let me give you a process answer because this is where we are,  Grassley replied to Raju.  Sen. Feinstein wanted to talk to me by phone today. I sent word back that I d like to have her and I sit down face-to-face and we ll work out all of the subpoenas and all the stuff we have to do in the future and work out a whole program. Raju pressed for more details, asking,  Are you okay, though, looking into the potential of obstruction of justice? Is that something for your committee? We re going to leave that to a conversation with Feinstein,  was Grassley s answer.Dianne Feinstein s letter to Grassley mainly focussed on fired Acting Attorney General Sally Yates, who, on January 26 and 27, warned White House counsel that then-National Security Advisor Michael Flynn had lied about his contact with the Russian Ambassador, leading to Flynn s forced resignation. She also mentioned that, if necessary, the committee could subpoena Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and National Security Agency Director Administrator Mike Rogers following their unforthcoming responses when questioned by the Senate Intelligence Committee.These could be the subpoenas that Chuck Grassley was referring to, but you can make up your own mind by reading Feinstein s letter and watching Raju and Grassley s exchange, here.GRASSLEY says he's meeting soon with Feinstein to discuss subpoeanas on Russia, FBI, Comey probes. https://t.co/wgNDVuy29D  Manu Raju (@mkraju) June 13, 2017Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"June 14, 2017",Fake

Now that a vast majority of Americans   many of which are probably Republicans or Trump voters   are finally admitting that they want Trump out of the White House, we couldn t be happier. It s clear that Trump s insane Russia scandal is taking a toll on his standing with the country, and his many losses are undoubtedly helping him become more unpopular by the day.These numbers from Gallup come just as the Senate Republicans are trying to roll out another health care bill   which will probably only make Trump s ratings plummet even more, considering how badly the first stab at Trumpcare hurt Trump s ratings.Trump loves boasting about his wins and records, but it s unlikely that he s going to want to brag about the fact that no president in history has gotten so unpopular so quickly   and the chances are, Trump is going to keep going down because he sabotages himself almost every day with his erratic behavior and social media habits. It won t be long before even more of the country turns against him, especially as Trump s Russia investigation is currently heating up. He can t hide from the facts for long   America won t let him.Featured image via Pool / Getty Images",News,"June 14, 2017",Fake
" BREAKING: Shooter Targets Congressional Republicans At Baseball Practice, Steve Scalise Shot","As the divisions in the nation bubble over, it seems that one person has snapped, and done the unthinkable: opened fire on a baseball practice full of Congressional Republicans in Alexandria, Virginia. Reports are steadily coming in, and it has been confirmed that House Majority Whip Steve Scalise has been shot. He is currently en route to a nearby hospital and is said to be in stable condition. There are also reports that Capitol Hill police officers and possibly Congressional aides have been injured as well. There is currently no reporting available on their condition. Reports suggest that the shooter was either taken down by Capitol Hill police or taken into custody.The really sad thing about this incident is that this practice was in preparation for a bipartisan baseball game that is supposed to promote unity between the two parties. Further, things would have been much worse if Rep. Scalise had not been there because Capitol Police would not have been present without a member of leadership in attendance.This is seriously the work of someone truly sick. No one should be killing anyone, for any reason, but certainly, this targeting of lawmakers at a baseball practice that was designed to help the nation take a break from ugly partisan politics is truly beyond the pale. Political violence is never acceptable, period.If this isn t proof that we really need to turn down the temperature when it comes to the rhetoric and divisions in this nation posthaste, I don t know what is.This is a developing story.

 NUTJOB Missouri State Rep Beheads Live Chicken On Facebook Video To Make Point About Abortion,"A Missouri state representative is making national headlines today after he shared a video on Facebook of him decapitating a living chicken to drive home his disgusting opinion about abortion.In the grotesque video, GOP state Rep. Mike Moon promotes his anti-abortion bill while he hangs a live chicken upside down from a tree branch.Mr. Moon then says, When the governor called for the second special session this year, I was right in the middle of my summer job. But like any good career politician, when I get the call, I m going back to work,  he happily exclaims as he starts to slice into the neck of the chicken, causing it to writhe around and flap its wings.He then proceeds to mutilate the chicken, pulling out its heart while lecturing about the need to protect human lives. God gave us man dominion over life. He allows us to raise animals properly and care for them and then process them for food so we can sustain life. And that s what I m doing here with this chicken. So we ve been called back to this special session for the primary purpose of supporting life, protecting the unborn specifically. I think we need to get to the heart of the matter here. So today, I m filing a bill that will lead to the stopping of abortion in the state of Missouri and I hope you ll support it. The Springfield News reports that Moon s bill emphasizes that Missouri protect the right to life of all humans, born and unborn   and to require due process of law before the life of any human, born or unborn, is ended prior to natural death. The National Abortion Rights Leauge didn t think the stunt was very funny and calls Moon out for playing  political games  with the healthcare of women. It was insulting watching Rep. Moon use the rights of women across Missouri as some kind of political prop,  the organization said.  His call to ban abortion is disturbing and dangerous, no matter what he does with that chicken. Hopefully, the backlash from this stunt will make Mr. Moon realize that women deserve access to healthcare, regardless of what he likes to do to chicken in the privacy of his own home.Feature image via Screen Capture",News,"June 14, 2017",Fake

Ironically, he seems to have abruptly decided that his political career may benefit from associating himself with Trump, as he was caught on video jostling his way through world leaders so stand beside Trump in a G-20 group photo.Macron left his position during the family picture to place himself next to US President Donald Trump as German Chancellor Angela Merkel watched on.Starting off near the back of the G20 group Mr. Macron appeared to lose his way before an aide tried to direct him to his spot.Noticing the commotion, Angela Merkel tapped Mr. Macron on the shoulder to get his attention but the French PM was already making his way through the world leaders.Mr. Macron jostled and kissed his way to the front in an awkward reshuffle.He finally joined Trump on the far left fringe at the G20 summit leaders  group photo.

Fox News host Lou Dobbs is furious that the FORMER President, Barack Obama, aka Barry Soetoro has been either following President Trump around the world to meet with world leaders or meeting with world leaders just prior to scheduled meetings with President Trump.Dobbs suggested to his viewers that Obama s meetings with various world leaders appear to all be organized. Why is the media ignoring Barack Obama s bizarre meetings with South Korea s new President Moon Jae-in, Britian s Prime Minister Theresa May, Canada s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and German Chancellor Angela Merkel? Would they have ignored former President George W. Bush if he embarked on a world tour to undercut or undermine Barack Obama only months after he was elected as our President?Perhaps someone needs to tell the FORMER President that in America, there s only ONE President at a time. Barry had his chance, and he failed miserably. It s time for him to step aside and let Donald Trump clean up the mess. It s hard enough to have to follow in the footsteps of America s worst President, the least Barry can do now for the sake of our nation, is to get out of his way Subversive Obama- Former President now doing his worst to undercut @POTUS and the will of the American people. #MAGA #TrumpTrain #Dobbs pic.twitter.com/GeQZMQLKDT  Lou Dobbs (@LouDobbs) July 6, 2017",politics,"Jul 7, 2017",Fake
#VeryFakeNews CNN Underestimated Their Opponent: New Report Shows CNN Takes MASSIVE Nosedive In Ratings,"CNN is finally seeing the serious repercussions of reporting #VeryFakeNews, while Fox News remains number one in ratings.CNN s ratings are plummeting, according to a Thursday cable TV rankings report by TV Newser.CNN fell to 10th in average total day viewership among all basic cable networks in the week of June 26 to July 2, far behind first-place Fox News and third-place MSNBC.An average of 639,000 viewers tuned in to CNN per day during the measurement period, less than half of the average 1,390,000 viewers who tuned in to Fox News per day during the same period.CNN s ratings slump is a remarkable drop from just a month ago, when CNN sat in fifth place among all basic cable networks the week of May 29 to June 4.CNN lost an average of 159,000 viewers per day from the week of May 29 to the week of June 26.Fox News and CNN continue to climb in ratings as CNN tumbles.Fox remained number one in all of basic cable, gaining an average of 7,000 viewers per day from the week of May 29 to the week of June 26.The Thursday ratings report is a slap in the face to CNN, which claimed on June 27 its  most-watched second quarter in history. CNN s rating slump occurred in the same week three CNN staffers resigned following a damaging retraction of a story that falsely linked a Trump transition official to the chief executive of a $10 billion Russian investment fund.The network was also hit with a number of undercover videos published by undercover journalist James O Keefe, one of which revealed a CNN health producer dismissing the Trump-Russia collusion narrative and another that revealed CNN contributor Van Jones labeling the Russia story a  nothing burger. Unfortunately for CNN, the ratings report released Thursday does not take into account the latest controversy to hit the network, indicating that its ratings could possibly plummet even further in the coming weeks.CNN came under fire Tuesday for apparently threatening to expose the identity of a private citizen who initially claimed credit for creating a GIF President Trump tweeted showing Trump tackling CNN.#CNNBlackmail trended worldwide Tuesday after the network made public its decision to mask the identity of the private citizen on the condition that the man no longer engages in what CNN considers to be  ugly behavior. Trump has continued to hammer CNN for being the standard-bearer of what he considers  fake news.   Western Journalism ",politics,"Jul 7, 2017",Fake

RADICAL NYC MAYOR Skips NYPD Swearing In Ceremony To Join Violent G-20 Protesters In Germanyâ€¦GOP Mayoral Candidate Slams Him On Social Media,"Mayor Bill de Blasio on Thursday skipped an NYPD swearing-in ceremony made somber by this week s assassination of a cop   then hours later revealed he was busy preparing to jet off on a surprise trip to join leftist protesters at the G-20 summit in Germany.Hizzoner s overseas jaunt was kept under wraps until just 90 minutes before he took off from Newark Airport. A last-minute announcement said he  will attend several events surrounding the G-20 Summit, including Saturday s Hamburg Zeigt Haltung rally. De Blasio will be the keynote speaker, organizers of the demonstration   Hamburg Shows Attitude   tweeted. The mayor also made sure the free trip will include a visit with his son, Dante, a Yale University student who s spending the summer on an internship in Berlin, a City Hall spokesman said.Presumptive Republican challenger Nicole Malliotakis accused de Blasio of abandoning pressing issues in the Big Apple to pursue his progressive agenda in Europe. Unbelievable. Instead of jet-setting around the world, he should be here doing his job,  said the Staten Island assemblywoman.  A police officer was murdered, street homelessness has skyrocketed and people continue to get delayed on the trains. Malliotakis   who later tweeted a doctored image showing de Blasio in an Alpine hat and lederhosen, grinning behind a plate of bratwurst, wienerschnitzel and Pilsner glasses   also blasted him for blowing off the NYPD ceremony at the Police Academy in Queens.Malliotakis jabs de Blasio with Photoshopped tweet over Germany trip https://t.co/DtTRaAQBXD via @nypmetro  carl campanile (@ccampy) July 7, 2017 The mayor should be embarrassed by the way he has treated the men and women of our police department,  she said.He is off gallivanting & I'm here pointing out problems w/ garbage collection, the most basic of city services  https://t.co/yW4MZ02u3O  Nicole Malliotakis (@NMalliotakis) July 7, 2017New Jersey Transit tweeted about a schedule change after a train was derailed yesterday while entering Penn Station in NYC, causing delays in transit for commuters:All Midtown DIRECT trains are being diverted into Hoboken Terminal.

"REPORT: ANTI-TRUMP, Open-Borders Clooneyâ€™s No Longer Feel Secure In Englandâ€¦Moving Back To U.S","Actor and immigration activist George Clooney will move to Los Angeles with his wife Amal and newborn twins Ella and Alexander due to security concerns at his England estate, according to a report.Life & Style magazine reported last week that the 56-year-old Oscar-winner will move his newly-expanded family to his mansion in Studio City, California, after deeming his 17th century mansion in Sonning, England to be not sufficiently safe for them. As soon as Amal found out she was pregnant, he hired former Secret Service agents to assess all his properties and make recommendations for improvement,  an unnamed Clooney  insider  told the magazine.  His mansion in Studio City [Calif.] was deemed the most secure, and it s within minutes of an LAPD station. He doesn t feel like Amal and the twins are safe living in the English countryside,  the source told Life & Style.  He s determined to move his family to LA, where he feels much more secure. The report comes as England has been rocked by terrorist attacks in recent months, including the terrorist bombing of a concert by pop singer Ariana Grande in Manchester in June that claimed the lives of 22 people, many of them young children.In May, British government officials disclosed that 23,000 known jihadi terrorists are believed to be residing in Britain, far more than the 3,000 that had initially been reported.The move for the Clooneys comes as both George and Amal have been among the most vocal and active celebrity advocates for open borders and the free flow of refugees between countries.In February of last year, the actor met privately with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and praised the German leader s acceptance of refugees from Syria and other countries. The same month, Clooney told Sky News in an interview that the United States is not doing  enough  to help Syrian refugees, and that 10,000 refugees per year was too low a figure to be admitting into the country.In an April 2016 interview with the BBC, Amal Clooney criticized then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump s plans to build a security wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, telling the outlet that the plan does not represent  U.S. values. George has also been an outspoken critic of Trump, telling The Guardian in a March 2016 interview that he believes Trump to be a  xenophobic fascist  and an  opportunist.  He previously described Trump s immigration policy proposals as  idiotic  and  intolerant.   Breitbart In July, 2016, it was reported that the Clooney s were considering moving from their mansion in Italy after a massive makeshift refugee camp was established in Lake Como, the popular and secluded celebrity hideaway where Hollywood A-lister George Clooney keeps a home.The migration of hundreds of people from Arab nations, Africa, and Asia was triggered following the Swiss government s decision to close its southern border with Italy.Now, waiting for smugglers to lead them into northern Europe, groups of migrants are camping out in tattered tents around the Lake Como resort.Flimsy dwellings, clothes and trash are scattered around the Northern Italian town s railway station, where dozens of new families and refugees have flocked.The migrant camp is, oddly enough, just steps away from the front door of immigration activists  George and Amal Clooney s multi-million dollar lakeside mansion in Lake Como, according to the Daily Mail.The power couple has spent some time talking about the migrant crisis. The Clooneys met privately with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in February and praised and thanked her for her leadership during the crisis.The Clooneys have taken refuge from the Hollywood spotlight in their summer home in Italy for years. Last year, Page Six reported that Clooney was mulling putting his Lake Como villa on the market due to ever-present and intrusive paparazzi.It is unclear if the recent deluge of refugees pouring into town will have an affect on Clooney s decision to sell or not.

TRUMP EXPOSES OBAMAâ€™S INCOMPETENCE: Cuts EPA Budgetâ€¦Still Fixes Flintâ€™s Water Crisis,"Although Obama had 3 years to take action to fix the Flint water problem, President Donald Trump has managed to do it in 2 months. The EPA has just issued a $100 million grant to the city of Flint, Michigan to replace the city s corroded and lead-polluted pipes.Critics of President Trump have lambasted him for his proposed budget cuts at the Environmental Protection Agency, saying the cuts are proof that he doesn t care about the environment.EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt released a statement saying,  The people of Flint and all Americans deserve a more responsive federal government  EPA will especially focus on helping Michigan improve Flint s water infrastructure as part of our larger goal of improving America s water infrastructure. Under authority granted the agency by the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act of 2016, the EPA just issued a $100 million grant to the beleaguered city of Flint, Michigan, to help in the effort at replacing the city s badly corroded and lead-tainted system of water pipes. We are excited and very grateful to receive these much-needed funds,  Flint Mayor Karen Weaver said.  The City of Flint being awarded a grant of this magnitude in such a critical time of need will be a huge benefit. The state of Michigan also contributed $20 million to match 20 percent of the grant. Meanwhile, CNN continues with their anti-Trump narrative and insists that President Trump had nothing to do with the grant and that it actually came from an action that former President Barack Obama and the prior Congress took in 2016. They are clearly blind to Trump s promise to fix the crumbling infrastructure of our country as soon as possible, something Obama never made a priority.CNN also obsessed over Trump s proposed 31 percent EPA budget cuts, failing to mention that the president had no intention of defunding programs to help improve the water system infrastructure.Despite the fact that Flint has been dealing with contaminated water for three years, Obama s EPA did not attempt to fix the problem. Now that Trump is in office, he is taking real action to make positive changes in the lives of Flint, MI citizens.Source: Conservative Tribune",politics,"Jul 6, 2017",Fake

Since the inauguration, CNN has mentioned  Russian story  nearly 16,000 times.Project Veritas  reporters can be seen in the video below having a conversation with CNN s supervising producer John Bonifield. The reporter talked to Bonifield first about the constant barrage of Trump-Russia stories on CNN. Bonifield admitted that although CNN has no evidence or proof of Trump involvement with Russia, they continue to make it their top story on CNN simply for  ratings  and to  make money.  Bonifield has worked as a journalist and as a producer for nearly 15 years at CNN, making him a pretty reliable source when it comes to how things work at CNN.Bonifield actually confessed to the undercover Project Veritas journalist that President Trump is correct when he says the media is on a  witch hunt  to take him down. Bonifield told the reporter:  I think the President is right to say, like, look you are  witch hunting me  You have no real smoking gun, you have no proof. Bonifield told the undercover reporter for Project Veritas that CNN is biased and is playing to their audience by attacking President Trump, and actually admitted that  Trump is good for business right now.  The Project Veritas reporter asked Bonifield,  But honestly, you think the whole Russia shit is bullshit?  to which Bonifield replied:  Could be bullshit. I mean, it s mostly bullshit right now. Like, we don t have any big, giant proof. The way these leaks happen, they d leak it. It d leak. If it was something really good, it would leak. Watch the unbelievable video here:Did the three resignations that took place at CNN today have anything to do with the impending release of O Keefe s explosive video proving that CNN manufactures Trump-Russia collusion stories for ratings, or for money?The story about the three CNN employees resigning for publishing fake news broke yesterday. Is ti a coincidence that today, O Keefe released this explosive bombshell video?Here s the story that broke yesterday: CNN employees have resigned for their role in pushing fake news about the Trump-Russia story that claimed a member of the Trump transition team was under investigation.Reporter Thomas Frank, editor Eric Lichtblau and executive editor Lex Haris all resigned from their positions following a company-wide investigation into the single-sourced story that was quickly debunked, The Washington Post first reported. CNN quickly followed up with a story of their own on the resignations. Lichtblau reportedly oversaw the false story, while Haris headed up CNN s investigative unit. In the aftermath of the retraction of a story published on CNN.com, CNN has accepted the resignations of the employees involved in the story s publication,  CNN s coverage quotes a company spokesman as saying.Philly.com   On Thursday evening, CNN investigative reporter Thomas Frank published a potentially explosive report involving an investigation of a Russian investment fund with potential ties to several associates of President Donald Trump.But by Friday night, the story was removed from CNN s website and all links were scrubbed from the network s social media accounts. That story did not meet CNN s editorial standards and has been retracted,  CNN said in an editors note posted in place of the story.  Links to the story have been disabled.

#FakeNewsMorningShow GMA Compares President Trump To N. Koreanâ€™s Murderous Dictator Kim Jong Un [VIDEO],"Beyond the pale ABC reporter Matthew Dowd compared President Donald Trump with N. Korea s Kim Jong Un on Good Morning America Wednesday when having discussion with former Clinton White House communications director Anchor George Stephanopoulos.As for the objectivity and credibility of Clinton Foundation mega-donor George Stephanopoulos, prior to the 2016 presidential election, his wife, Ali Wentworth, claimed the couple would leave the country should Donald Trump become president of the United States. Of course they didn t leave the country. George Stephanopoulos chose instead, to remain in the US as a prominent voice on TV railing against our sitting President.The comments came following a report about N. Korea s intercontinental ballistic missile test and a discussion on the upcoming G20 summit where Trump will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Well, George, I think there s real tension,  Dowd replied.  You take Vladimir Putin on one, but there s real tension with a lot of members of the G20. If you look at the recent polling in the international community, Donald Trump is not believed by most of the people in the European community to be trusted to do the right thing, and you take with that with Vladimir Putin, and now with what s happened in North Korea. The European community is worried about unpredictable erratic leaders, not only one in North Korea but one in the United States of America.   MRCTVWatch:George Stephanopoulos has been initiating attacks on Donald Trump since he became a serious contender in the presidential race. The video below shows a heated exchange between George Stephanopoulos and President Trump s former Senior Campaign Advisor Kellyanne Conway only one month after Trump crushed Hillary in the election. (Notice how ABC starts out the interview between Stephanopoulos and Conway by flashing a screen shot of Hillary s popular vote numbers compared to Trump s when they have nothing to do with the context of the conversation.

NEW REPORT: OBAMAPHONE Program Stashed $9 BILLION In Private Bank Accountsâ€¦Exposes Massive Windfall For Phone Companies,"Who could forget the  Obamaphone Lady  from Cleveland, OH, who unashamedly told an interviewer she was voting for Obama because all minorities in Cleveland get a free Obamaphone from Obama, and  He s gonna do more!  She actually woke up and admitted that she, and other minorities had been played by Obama in a follow-up video at the bottom of the page.The controversial  Obamaphone  program, which pays for cellphones for the poor, is rife with fraud, according to a new government report released Thursday that found more than a third of enrollees may not even be qualified.Known officially as the Lifeline Program, the phone giveaway became a symbol of government waste in the previous administration. Now a new report from the Government Accountability Office bears out those concerns.The report, requested by Sen. Claire McCaskill, Missouri Democrat, also says the program has stashed some $9 billion in assets in private bank accounts rather than with the federal treasury, further increasing risks and depriving taxpayers of the full benefit of that money. A complete lack of oversight is causing this program to fail the American taxpayer   everything that could go wrong is going wrong,  said Mrs. McCaskill, ranking Democrat on the Senate s chief oversight committee and who is a former state auditor in Missouri. We re currently letting phone companies cash a government check every month with little more than the honor system to hold them accountable, and that simply can t continue,  she said. The program, run by the Federal Communications Commission, predates President Obama, but it gained attention during his administration when recipients began to associate the free phone with other benefits he doled out to the poor.   Washington TimesThe Daily Caller reported:A massive portion of Obamaphone recipients are receiving the benefit after lying on their applications, according to a new 90-page report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO).An undercover sting operation showed ineligible applications were approved 63 percent of the time, and a review that found that 36 to 65 percent of beneficiaries in various categories had lied in easily-detectable ways but were approved anyway.The fraud reached unheard-of proportions because the Federal Communications Commission let the task of screening for eligibility fall to phone companies that profit off of enrolling as many people as possible.GAO undercover investigators applied for free government phones 19 times using criteria that should have been rejected, and  we were approved to receive Lifeline services by 12 of the 19 Lifeline providers using fictitious eligibility documentation. All someone has to do to apply for free cell phone service is say that they are on another welfare program, such as food stamps or disability, known as SSI.When Congress considered reforms, phone companies took out daily full-page ads in publications read by Capitol Hill staffers. The wife of the CEO of TracFone, the largest beneficiary of Obamaphones, was a mega-fundraiser for former President Barack Obama.The cause of the fraud rates, shocking even by federal government standards, was always clear: The FCC allowed companies with a profit motive to sign up as many people as possible to determine eligibility.Phone companies swooped into housing projects in vans with neon flashing lights to register users. A woman approached by one such representative outside of a welfare office told The Daily Caller News Foundation Investigative Group the man encouraged her to enroll her two-year-old.The companies weren t checking eligibility, and the FCC wasn t ensuring they did or punishing those who didn t. Additionally, the FCC failed to provide many companies with the intra-government databases that would give them the ability to perform some checks, the GAO found.The Obamaphone Lady aka Michelle Dowry made an appearance on Alex Jones  show where she admitted to finally waking up, as she discovered that Barack Obama s presidency was a giant hoax. The only thing that Michele and the rest of the the minority community Obama promised to help got during his 8 years in office was a tax-payer funded  free  phone:",politics,"Jul 5, 2017",Fake

WATCH: MIKE HUCKABEE DEFENDS Daughter Sarahâ€¦Makes Hilarious Comparison To Media And Preschool Age Grandchildren,"Mike Huckabee appeared on FOX s Hannity show where Kimberly Guilfoyle was filling in for host Sean Hannity. Guilfoyle congratulated the former Governor Mike Huckabee s daughter Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders for her handling of the hypocritical press. Guilfoyle talked about the media and how they attacked President Trump for retweeting a hilarious video made to look like he was body-slamming CNN, while ignoring the Central Park play where President Trump was stabbed to death on the stage in front of thousands.Huckabee told Kimberly Guilfoyle he was proud of his daughter and how she s handled the constant attacks by the media. Huckabee gave a hilarious example of why he believes his daughter is able to handle the leftist media so well: I think my daughter is handling this very well because she has three preschoolers at home. So she s used to dealing with petulant children who ask the same question over and over hoping to get a different answer, the one that they want. And so maybe that s part of the reason she s able to stay flat-footed, look those folks in the eye and handle it. ",politics,"Jul 4, 2017",Fake

FILMMAKER DINESH Dâ€™SOUZA: Eight Things I LOVE About America!,"FILMMAKER DINESH D SOUZA S Eight things I LOVE about America!  To make us love our country,  Edmund Burke once said,  our country ought to be lovely.  Burke s point is that we should love our country not just because it is ours, but also because it is good. America is far from perfect, and there is lots of room for improvement. In spite of its flaws, however, American life as it is lived today is the best life that our world has to offer. Ultimately America is worthy of our love and sacrifice because, more than any other society, it makes possible the good life, and the life that is good.  America provides an amazingly good life for the ordinary guy  Rich people live well everywhere. But what distinguishes America is that it provides an impressively high standard of living for the  common man. America offers more opportunity and social mobility than any other country, including the countries of Europe  America is the only country that has created a population of  self-made tycoons.  Only in America could Pierre Omidyar, whose parents are Iranian and who grew up in Paris, have started a company like eBay. Work and trade are respectable in America  Historically most cultures have despised the merchant and the laborer, regarding the former as vile and corrupt and the latter as degraded and vulgar. Examples: ancient Greece and medieval Islam But the American founders altered this moral hierarchy. America has achieved greater social equality than any other society  True, there are large inequalities of income and wealth in America. These gaps in material wealth exist on every inch of the globe. But Americans are socially more equal than any other people, and this is unaffected by economic disparities. Alexis de Tocqueville noticed this egalitarianism a century and a half ago and it is, if anything, more prevalent today. For all his riches, Bill Gates could not approach the typical American and say,  Here s a $100 bill. I ll give it to you if you kiss my feet.  Most likely, the person would tell Gates where to go! The American view is that the rich guy may have more money, but he isn t in any fundamental sense better than anyone else. In America the destiny of the young is not given to them, but created by them  In most countries in the world, your fate and your identity are handed to you; in America, you determine them for yourself. America is a country where your life is like a blank sheet of paper, and you are the artist. This notion of being the architect of your own destiny is the incredibly powerful idea that is behind the worldwide appeal of America. America has gone further than any other society in establishing equality of rights  Sadly, there is nothing distinctively American about slavery or bigotry. Slavery has existed in virtually every culture, and xenophobia, prejudice and discrimination are worldwide phenomena. Western civilization is the only civilization to mount a principled campaign against slavery; no country expended more treasure and blood to get rid of slavery than the United States. While racism remains a problem, this country has made strenuous efforts to eradicate discrimination, even to the extent of enacting policies that give legal preference in university admissions, jobs, and government contracts. It is extremely unlikely that a racist society would have permitted such policies in the first place. America has found a solution to the problem of religious and ethnic conflict that continues to divide and terrorize much of the world  Visitors to places like New York are amazed to see the way in which Serbs and Croatians, Sikhs and Hindus, Irish Catholics and Irish Protestants, Jews and Palestinians, all seem to work and live together in harmony. How is this possible when these same groups are spearing each other and burning each other s homes in so many places in the world? The American answer is, do not extend rights to racial or ethnic groups but only to individuals; in this way, all are equal in the eyes of the law, opportunity is open to anyone who can take advantage of it, and everybody who embraces the American way of life can truly  become American. America has the kindest, gentlest foreign policy of any great power in world history  Critics of the United States are likely to react to this truth with sputtering outrage. Quoting a laundry list of American sins. What the critics leave out is the other side of the story. Twice in the 20th century, the United States saved the world   first from the Nazi threat, then from Soviet totalitarianism. What would have been the world s fate if America had not existed? After destroying Germany and Japan in World War II, the United States proceeded to rebuild both countries, and today they are American allies. Now we are doing the same thing in Afghanistan and Iraq. For the most part America is an abstaining superpower; it shows no real interest in conquering and subjugating the rest of the world. (Imagine how the Soviets would have acted if they had won the Cold War.) On occasion the United States intervenes to overthrow a tyrannical regime or to halt massive human rights abuses in another country, but it never stays to rule that country. In Grenada, Haiti and Bosnia, the United States got in and then it got out. U.S. troops build hospitals, orphanages and schools across the globe. Almost everyday American planes dropped food and medical supplies to avert hardship and starvation. What other country does these things? What other superpower in history has such moral restraint on its unequaled power? -list by D. D Souza",politics,"Jul 4, 2017",Fake

OMINOUS WARNING TO EUROPEANS: You Are Committing Self-Murderâ€¦Life As You Know It Is About To Changeâ€¦Immigrants Will Bring Their Wars To Your Doorstep [VIDEO],"Douglas Murray, author of The Strange Death Of Europe: Immigration, Identity, Islam gives a stunning account of the  self murder  or Europe in the  Death Of Europe  article published by ExpressUKI have travelled to the places where migrants continue to land and the places where they keep ending up. Everywhere I have gone I have come to the same conclusion: our continent is in the process of self-murder.Amid the day-to-day distraction of life and politics, it is easy to forget this biggest event of our time. All pale into insignificance besides the story of the loss by Europeans of the only place we had to call home.Whenever this country does have a debate about immigration it is minuscule. It tends to focus on Calais. The British public sees footage of people sitting in makeshift tents or hurling missiles into the roads to slow the trucks down so they can board them and break into Britain.Each time actors, celebrities and politicians head to Calais and visit the camp. They return to tell the British public that it must be more open-hearted and generous.The argument they make is humane. It is an understandable reaction to human misery but it is a core part of our society s suicide mission.Take that example of Calais. Before the latest clearance of the camp there were about 6,000 people living there. None of them should have been there.By being there they had already broken every one of the rules that our continent put in place which demands they seek asylum in the first country of arrival. Almost nobody arrives into France first.All these people have landed in Greece or Italy and made their way north.And yet still the celebrities and others pick at our consciences. Can we not be generous and at least let in the people who are there? It is wholly understandable   and also ill-informed madness.Over this year s Easter weekend alone about 8,000 people were picked up between the coast of north Africa and the south of Italy.They were described   as everyone always is   as being  rescued . In fact what happens   what has been happening for years   is that each day boats filled with migrants set out from north Africa.During the heights of the migration crisis of 2015, when Germany s Chancellor Angela Merkel opened up the doors of Europe to the world, the whole continent began to buckle.But in reality that flood of millions into Europe only sped up a process that had been under way for years. Ever since the postwar period European governments had encouraged migrant workers to come in.At first   as Chancellor Merkel herself admitted in a speech in 2010   they expected the workers to return home. But they didn t. They stayed. As did the flow after that and the ones for decades after that.The governments of countries such as ours failed to get anything right. All their predictions were wrong for decades. They were wrong that people would stay for only a short time. Wrong to think that they would not continue to come in large numbers.Wrong that they might not want to bring their extended families to join them. And wrong to think that once the tap was turned on anything but very radical action could ever bring the numbers to a controllable level.During the course of researching The Strange Death Of Europe: Immigration, Identity, Islam, I have travelled to see the places where those migrants who arrive on our continent end up. Last year the migrant crisis was widely believed to have slowed down.But it had not and its effects were still visible everywhere. In the outskirts of Paris I saw hundreds of young sub-Saharan men living in tents in the middle of roadways. The French police would occasionally move them a few hundred feet further along.In remote parts of Sweden areas that used to be filled with Swedes are inhabited instead by the residents of other continents.Still the dream of some Europeans is that the arrivals into Europe will become European. It is more likely that Europe will simply begin to look increasingly Third World.

Fitton said:  I don t understand what this investigation is about.. You know my count is 14, 15 lawyers to have working on this one investigation to investigate to investigate what? An employment dispute between Comey and the President? You have the conflicts caused by Comey leaking records to get Mueller appointed, you have Constitutional concerns about the way the office operates.

Sununu:  If the President is being investigated for obstruction of justice, the White House should have been officially notified. Sununu:  What bothers me the most and there must be a reason for it, is Mueller making four of his first hires so blatantly biased lawyers, pro-Democrat lawyers with a bias certainly against the President. Maybe Mueller has decided internally that this isn t going anywhere and that the only way he can have credibility on a decision saying that there s nothing there is to have that decision come from a group of lawyers that are so blatantly biased against the President.

They have been magnificent. Thank you.Today s ceremony has very special meaning because today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or one party to another but we are transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the people.For too long a small group in our nation s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered but the jobs left and the factories closed. The establishment protected itself but not the citizens of our country. Their victories have not been your victories, their triumphs have not been your triumphs.And while they celebrated in our nation s capital there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.That all changes right here and right now because this moment is your moment. It belongs to you.It belongs to everyone gathered here today, and everyone watching all across America.This is your day, this is your celebration, and this, the United States of America, is your country.What truly matters is not which party controls our government but whether our government is controlled by the people. Jan. 20, 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again.The forgotten men and women of this country will be forgotten no longer.Everyone is listening to you now. You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before.At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction that a nation exists to serve its citizens. Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families and good jobs for themselves. These are just and reasonably demands of righteous people and a righteous public.But for too many of our citizens a different reality existsMothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system flush with cash but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge. And the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.We are one nation   and their pain is our pain. Their dreams are our dreams; and their success will be our success. We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny.The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans.For many decades, we ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry; subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military; we ve defended other nation s borders while refusing to defend our own; and spent trillions of dollars overseas while America s infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.We ve made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon.One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions and millions of American workers that were left behind.The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the entire world.But that is the past. And now we are looking only to the future.We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power.From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land.From this day forward, it s going to be only America First.Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American families.We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs. Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.I will fight for you with every breath in my body   and I will never, ever let you down.America will start winning again, winning like never before.We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams.We will build new roads, and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across our wonderful nation.We will get our people off of welfare and back to work   rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor.We will follow two simple rules: Buy American and hire American.We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world   but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example   we will shine   for everyone to follow.We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones   and unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth.At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.The Bible tells us,  How good and pleasant it is when God s people live together in unity.

TRUMP DRIVES CRITICS CRAZY: Eliminates Obamaâ€™s Czarsâ€¦Pays Female Staffers More Than Menâ€¦Saves Taxpayers Millions!,"Meanwhile, back at CNN Russia Russia Russia!The White House payroll is an excellent example of Trump s commitment to shrink government and save taxpayers money. The White House released the report of Trump s staffers  salaries in a 16-page report on Friday, resulting in projected four-year savings of more than $22 million. Not only is President Trump refusing to take his $400,000 salary, but also eliminating czars (which Obama came under fire for hiring starting in 2009), expensive  fellowships , and spending on FLOTUS staff.Here are some key findings:Some special initiative czars that worked for President Obama include Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change Carol Browner ($172,000), Director of the Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships Joshua DuBois ($98,000), White House Director of Urban Affairs Adolfo Carrion Jr ($158,500), and Director of the White House Office of Health Reform Nancy-Ann DeParle ($158,500).The reports also confirm only 5 staffers dedicated to First Lady Melania Trump, compared to Michelle Obama s outrageous 24 staffers.Trump also eliminated positions in the White House Leadership Development program which was instituted by President Obama in 2015. Positions included that of Elaine Ho at a salary of $158,700 who was in charge of working with the Office of the First Lady to implement her  Let Girls Learn  initiative. Two  Directors  whose positions were also eliminated from the payroll include Pamela Coleman ($120,000) and Katherine Pielemeier ($60,876).Gary Cohn, president of Goldman Sachs and current Director of the White House National Economic Council, and Christopher Liddell, Director of Strategic Initiatives in the White House and a former Microsoft Chief Financial Officer, are serving with reduced salaries of $30,000.President Trump donated his first quarter paycheck to the Dept. of Interior for construction and repair needs in military cemeteries.

â€œWITH ALL DUE RESPECTâ€: HHS Sec Tom Price Runs Circles Around NBCâ€™s Chuck Todd [Video],"NBC s Chuck Todd was no match for the astute HHS Sec Tom Price in an interview today on the healthcare bill. Todd tried to get Price to badmouth Trump at the 6:45 point Not gonna happen!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIis3b-tMCUHealth & Human Services Secretary Tom Price joined NBC s Chuck Todd today to discuss healthcare but Todd tried to get Price to bad-mouth the president.Chuck Todd started out being combative on the healthcare bill and then moved on to bashing President Trump.Chuck Todd goes there:  Let me ask you about the tone of the president s tweets. Many Republicans in the Senate condemned the personal attack on Mika Brzezinski and attacking on her looks. You have Lindsey Graham saying it was  beneath the office.  Ben Sasse,  This isn t normal.  Jeff Flake,  Beneath the dignity of the presidency.  Susan Collins begging,  This has to stop.  Lisa Murkowski begging,  This has to stop.  Does his behavior bother you? HHS Sec Tom Price wasn t about to go there and handled the uncomfortable situation beautifully:  Well, what I m concentrated on is the job that he s given me. And that is to make certain that we fulfill the mission of the Department of Health and Human Services, which is to improve the health, safety, and well-being of the American people. And there are a whole array of activities that we re undertaking. One of them is this piece of legislation that s in the Senate right now. But my job is consumed by making certain that we fulfill the mission at the department. Todd follows up with this rude question:  I m just asking you as a father. If your son tweeted about a woman like that, what would you say to him? Price fired back:  Chuck, you know, this is really remarkable. You ve got incredible challenges across this nation, incredible challenges around the world. The challenge that I ve been given is to address the health care issues. And your program, a program with the incredible history of Meet the Press, and that s what you want to talk about? Let me suggest to you that the American people want to talk about the challenges. Chuck Todd then tried to twist and spin his way out of the corner he just painted himself into:  Mr. Secretary, with all due respect, you re blaming me for what the president of the United States has spent his entire week focused on? HAHA! CHUCK TODD STEPS IN IT WITH THAT COMMENT PRICE BURIES HIM WITH THIS LAST COMMENT: No, listen to me, with all due respect. The American people are concerned about a health care system that is not providing choices, where premiums are going up, where insurance companies are vacating markets all across this land. And that s what they want us to concentrate on. And that s what they want us to fix. And that s what I and the president are working on. BOOM! ",politics,"Jul 2, 2017",Fake
MEDIA GOES NUTS After Trump Tweets HILARIOUS VIDEO Showing Him Body-Slamming CNN,"President Trump on Sunday tweeted a video of him body-slamming World Wrestling Entertainment Chairman Vince McMahon whose face was replaced by the CNN logo.The tweet, which said,  #FraudNewsCNN #FNN,  linked to a video of the president decking, pummeling and then shaving off McMahon s hair during a  Battle of the Billionaires  stunt at WrestleMania XXIII in 2007.#FraudNewsCNN #FNN pic.twitter.com/WYUnHjjUjg  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 2, 2017McMahon is the husband of Linda McMahon, who heads Trump s Small Business Administration.President Barack Obama hosted felon and radical organizer Bob Creamer (the guy who was caught on video talking about how he was organizing paid protesters to incite violence at Trump rallies) at the White House over 100 times while he was in office. After the undercover video was released that exposed the Democrats plan to incite violence against innocent Trump supporters, the media was silent. The media was also silent when it was discovered that Obama s Attorney General Eric Holder, used taxpayer funds to pay people to protest against George Zimmerman in the heated Trayvon Martin case, which was the birthplace of the violent Black Lives Matter movement. Those protests marked the first step in Obama s plan to divide America.In a statement on Twitter, CNN recalled comments from White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders last week that the president doesn t condone violence against the media. The President in no way form or fashion has ever promoted or encouraged violence. If anything, quite the contrary.    @SHSanders45 6/29/17,  the CNN tweet said.Bipartisan condemnation against the take-down video continued to build Sunday morning.GOP Rep. Eric Swalwell urged all Republicans to rebuke the Tweet or be complicit in its message. I am calling on EVERY @HouseGOP Member of Congress to condemn this. You were elected to be a check on power. Check it, or you condone it,  the California representative tweeted on Sunday.Minority House Leader Nancy Pelosi also blasted the tweet. Violence & violent imagery to bully the press must be rejected. This #July4th, celebrate freedom of the press, guardians to our democracy,  she wrote on Twitter.Paul Joseph Watson sums up the media hypocrisy beautifully with this one tweet:Trump is ""inciting violence"" with a wrestling meme, says same media that literally painted a crosshair target on Trump's head. pic.twitter.com/m8V8XjYHU0  Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) July 2, 2017A Trump administration official said he doesn t view Trump s tweet as inciting violence against the media. Certainly not, though I think that no one would perceive that as a threat. I hope they don t. I do think that [Trump is] beaten up in a way on cable platforms that he has a right to respond to,  Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert said on ABC s  This Week. He said cable news shows are  not always very fair to the president,  who developed a social media platform to speak directly to the  American people. Trump is  the most genuine president and the most non-politician president we ve seen in my lifetime,  he said.Watch #FakeNewsCNN  experts  call Trump  Dangerous  and a  Fascist :The president was also the subject of bipartisan scorn last Thursday when he posted the  bleeding badly  tweet about Brzezinski, with many lawmakers saying it was beneath the dignity of the office.Trump defended his use of social media in a tweet on Saturday. My use of social media is not Presidential   it s MODERN DAY PRESIDENTIAL. Make America Great Again!,  he wrote. NYPNOTE TO CNN: Re-tweeting a video that s been around for years showing a fake body-slam by then businessman Trump is a far cry from promoting violence. If you were so concerned about violence, why didn t you do any stories on felon, husband of a United States Congresswoman and Democrat operative who was caught on tape planning to incite violence at Trump rallies before he even became our President?

THE KING OF â€œUS vs THEMâ€ POLITICS Claims Trump Has Divisive Policies: â€œFight against the politics of â€˜us and themâ€™ [Video],"Obama urged Indonesians on Saturday to resist divisive politics based on race and religion It was REALLY just another swipe at Trump. He s done this fear mongering over and over before (see video below from 2016) and he s doing it again by taking a veiled swipe at President Trump during his visit to Indonesia: *FYI-He gave the same BS speech on 9/11, 1/13, 6/16, 11/16   ANOTHER FYI   This has been the mantra of the Obamas for years! Check out Monica Crowley s take below. She calls out these political grifters who always PROJECT wrongdoing on others. Aren t THEY the ones who are guilty of the very thing they re claiming someone else is doing?CHECK THIS TOTAL BS OUT: I love that for Barack, there is no such thing as  us  and  them    he doesn t care whether you re a Democrat, a Republican, or none of the above. He knows that we all love our country. And he s always ready to listen to good ideas. He s always looking for the very best in everyone he meets.    Michelle Obama The Guardian reported:The former US president said some countries had adopted  an aggressive kind of nationalism  and  increased resentment of minority groups , in a speech in Indonesia on Saturday that could be seen as a commentary on the US as well as Indonesia.Obama, who was on a personal visit to the country where he spent some of his childhood, said the Muslim community in Indonesia had historically protected Hindu and Buddhist temples. Indonesia is made of thousands of islands, hundreds of languages, scores of regions and ethnic groups. So my time here made me cherish and respect for people s differences,  he told a packed audience in Jakarta.Obama stopped short of mentioning any specific cases of racial or religious intolerance. It is very important here in Indonesia, the United States, Europe, everywhere, to fight against the politics of  us and them ,  he said to cheers from thousands of mostly Indonesians who have worked or studied abroad.He arrived in Jakarta after visiting the cultural city of Yogyakarta and white-water rafting on the tourist island of Bali. He also met Indonesian President Joko Widodo in Bogor, south of the capital.Indonesia, a country of 250 million people, has experienced rising intolerance against non-Muslims and the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.A leader of Indonesia s second-largest Muslim organization this week called for a boycott of Starbucks, saying that the international coffee chain s pro-gay stand risks ruining the  religious and cultured  core of the country.MONICA CROWLEY CALLED THE OBAMAS OUT WHEN MICHELLE GAVE A SPEECH REFERRING TO BARACK S  US vs THEM  Mantra:Last night, Michelle Obama took the stage and delivered a speech meant to rally the Democratic faithful and to humanize her husband. After nearly four years of his presidency, it does seem odd that she still has to humanize him. That s usually something that more unknown challengers must do. But the perception of Obama as an aloof, distant, egotistical narcissist has been growing, so Michelle was dispatched to paint a warmer picture of him. If Team Obama is worried about THAT at this late hour as well as worrying about their base they know they re in trouble.For what it was, Michelle s speech was solid, and she certainly knows how to deliver. It was a home run, the same way Ann Romney s speech was a home run last week. But one short paragraph has become the definitive theme of the speech, because it rings so outrageously false. She said,  I love that for Barack, there is no such thing as  us  and  them    he doesn t care whether you re a Democrat, a Republican, or none of the above. He knows that we all love our country. And he s always ready to listen to good ideas. He s always looking for the very best in everyone he meets. The ONLY thing Obama has done since taking office is divide on the basis of  us  vs.  them.  He and his team have divided Americans by class (by incessantly slamming the  1%,   millionaires and billionaires,  commanding them to do their  fair share,  etc).He has divided by race (see Joe Biden s recent comment,  They re gonna put y all back in chains ).He has divided by age (attempting to scare seniors by falsely and dishonestly suggesting that the Republicans  Medicare reforms would toss grandma off the cliff, and by giving away the store to college kids on student loans).And he has divided by gender (ginning up a completely bogus GOP  war on women. )As far as Michelle s comment that Obama  doesn t care whether you re a Democrat, a Republican, or none of the above,  and  he s always ready to listen to good ideas ,  Obama hasn t met with the GOP in over a year, scolded them on Day One of his presidency with  I won,  told a Democrat who had voted against the stimulus,  Don t think we re not keeping score, brother,  and once referred to  punishing our enemies.  Not exactly the warm n  fuzzy Barack Michelle was desperately trying to paint.And as far as  listening to good ideas,  he blew off his own deficit reduction commission, Simpson-Bowles, as well as Paul Ryan s budget reform ideas and disregarded moderate Democrats  ideas to carry out health reform more slowly and with GOP buy-in (see: defeated Arkansas Senator Blanche Lincoln and her pleas to Obama, which fell on deaf ears).So: Michelle can try all she wants to resurrect Obama s 2004 image of a guy who said  there s not a red America or a blue America,  and she and other Democrats can try to invoke his 2008 image of the transcendent guy sitting above petty politicking and business-as-usual. But after nearly four years of division, distraction, and destruction, not many people are buying that sales pitch anymore. It s old, it s tired, and like his radical redistributionism, it s done.",politics,"Jul 2, 2017",Fake

NUMEROUS PUBLIC Rapes Of Teenage Girls Reported At Swedish Music Festivals: â€œRapes at Swedish festivals are not really news anymoreâ€,"Last year, we reported about women who attended an  anti-racism  music festival in Sweden that were raped and molested by migrant men. This report is yet another shocking example of how the west is actually importing a real rape culture.According to police spokesman Stefan Dangardt, numerous  foreign men  sexually assaulted the women during Borl nge s  Peace and Love  festival, although three suspects who were arrested were later released because they claimed they were minors.It appears that nothing has changed since last year. Yesterday, Swedish police received several reports of rape after   music festivals at various locations on Friday evening.A 15-year-old girl was raped during a concert at the Br valla Festival in Norrk ping on Friday night.According to the police, the girl was held and raped by a man in the midst of the crowd in front of the concert goers, without anyone intervening.

ERIC HOLDER Encourages DOJ To Keep Attacking Trumpâ€¦STUNNING List Of Holder Scandals Reveals Why Trump Needs To Drain Obamaâ€™s Corrupt DOJ Swamp,"The most corrupt Attorney General in the history of the United States is allegedly thinking of throwing his hat into the ring as a Democrat contender in the 2020 Presidential race. What better way to invigorate crooked Democrats than to call on the very people who had his back at the DOJ to keep attacking President Trump?Former Attorney General Eric Holder spoke in Los Angeles last week to promote a bill that some observers say would make California a  sanctuary state,  an appearance that he says is the start of a new phase of his career in which he plans to reenter the world of politics. Up to now, I have been more behind-the-scenes,  Holder told Yahoo News in a new interview published Tuesday, describing his plans.  But that s about to change. Holder, who served as former President Barack Obama s first attorney general, indicated that his goal is to head the legal resistance to President Donald Trump s agenda. But that may just be the tip of the iceberg.Three sources who have spoken to Holder and are familiar with his thinking told Yahoo that he may consider challenging Trump in 2020 for the White House. Now is the time to be more visible,  Holder said.  Now is the time to be heard. Holder made his voice heard on Twitter yesterday, as he called on the DOJ and FBI to keep up their attacks on President Trump:To the career men & women at DOJ/FBI: your actions and integrity will be unfairly questioned. Be prepared, be strong. Duty. Honor. Country.  Eric Holder (@EricHolder) June 30, 2017Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton whose legal group has helped to expose numerous Holder scandals had this to say about Eric Holder s tweet:Obama's first corrupt AG encourages continued Deep State attacks on @realDonaldTrump. https://t.co/9dacBFmdZd  Tom Fitton (@TomFitton) July 1, 2017Eric Holder s scandalsContempt of Congress   On June 28, 2012, Eric Holder became the first and only US Attorney General in American history to be held in Contempt of Congress on both civil and criminal grounds. The US House vote was 255-67, with Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and 16 other Democrats walking out in protest and refusing to vote. President Obama called the action  politically motivated  and cited Executive Privilege for refusing to remove his own Attorney General. It then fell on Eric Holder s own Justice Dept to prosecute him, which it declined to do.Black Power   Eric Holder s earliest scandal dates back to his college days at Columbia. There, he was campus leader of a black power organization and a public supporter of the Black Panther Party. He organized sit-ins at the school demanding that the ROTC office be officially renamed in honor of Malcolm X.Fort Hood cover-up   After the 2009 Fort Hood massacre by US Army Major Nidal Hasan which took 13 lives, the Justice Dept report on the incident refused to mention Hasan s extreme Islamic beliefs and instead ruled the mass shooting a workplace incident, not an act of terror.Spying on Associated Press   The Justice Dept was caught spying on Associated Press by collecting months worth of phone records at the news wire, as well as the home phones of reporters and editors. The telephone records the DoJ secretly investigated included the phones at the AP s offices in Washington DC, New York, Hartford, and even the AP s phone inside the US House of Representatives.Spying on Fox News   The DoJ monitored the personal email and phone of a Fox News reporter, as well as the Fox News phones in New York and Washington. The Justice Dept said the news outlet had temporarily lost its press freedom when its reporter received classified information from a CIA whistleblower.War on Gun Owners   AG Holder has said that his interpretation of the US Constitution is that the Second Amendment guaranteeing the right to keep and bear arms only applies to the Militia. And to him, the Militia is the modern day National Guard and Reserves. Researchers have pointed out that in every instance where state and local authorities have sought the legal advice from the DoJ on proposed gun control laws, the Justice Dept has approved every single one.Protecting Black Power and Voter Intimidation   On Election Day in 2008, the New Black Panther Party had set up at Philadelphia polling places, threatening white voters, hurling racial slurs and stopping white voters from voting. The tactics were caught on video and the assailants were identified. After a national outrage, the DoJ refused to take action on either the hate crimes or the Voting Rights violations.Stimulus Program   Out of President Obama s $800 billion 2009  Stimulus Program , AG Holder was handed $1 billion of the money to be handed out to local law enforcement officials across the country. Most of the stimulus money turned out to be used as kick-backs to Obama campaign contributors, including Eric Holder who himself was a top campaign bundler for the 2008 Obama campaign.Foreigners voting in US Elections   Through his entire tenure, the Attorney General has steadfastly insisted that voters not be required to prove their identity when casting a ballot. The AG publicly touts that his DoJ has challenged two dozen state laws and Governor s executive orders requiring voters to show an official ID before voting.Foreign Terrorists have Rights   The DoJ declared that foreign terrorists captured almost anywhere other than a military battlefield were entitled to the same civil rights as US citizens.Buying the Justice Dept   In his book  Extortion , author Peter Schweizer details how President Obama chose the people who would head his Justice Dept   he sold the positions.  When President Obama established his Justice Department staff after the 2008 election, something unprecedented happened,  Schweizer writes,  For the first time, at least half a dozen senior positions were occupied by individuals who had been campaign bundlers (fund raisers) for a presidential candidate, including not only Attorney General Eric Holder but also senior officials who dealt with criminal and civil prosecutions.  Those high level Justice Dept appointees who are accused of buying their jobs are,  Associate Attorney General Thomas Perrelli, Deputy Associate Attorney General Karol Mason, and Associate Attorney General Tony West. Stealing 1,000,000 American Homes   Immediately after the housing collapse of 2007 and the economic collapse of 2008, America s largest mortgage lenders began criminally foreclosing on hundreds of thousands of American families without cause and using  robo-signing machines . Most didn t even have mortgages, much less with those banks. Sheriff s across the country removed a half million American families at gun point for no legitimate reason, only because banks had fraudulently filed foreclosure papers. The number of victims was so large, the DoJ cut off new claimants in 2012 when the number of properties stolen by six Wall Street banks hit 750,000. Since then, hundreds of thousands more families have been refused any justice or reimbursement at all by AG Holder. And for the 750,000 families the Justice Dept sued the banks for and settled with, the banks were ordered to pay each family an average of $2,000 each   $2,000 as total reimbursement for a $100,000 home criminally stolen, and all the furniture and possessions inside when the bank and police forced the families into the street. The settlement negotiated by the Justice Dept also bars the victims from ever suing the banks to get their money back. The five banks that stole one million American homes and businesses and were protected by AG Holder and the DoJ were Bank of America, Wells Fargo, JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup, and Ally Financial.Prosecuting Journalists   When Anonymous hackers leaked documents from Defense Dept contractors showing that the corporation had a program to spy on the American people inside and outside their homes, a number of news outlets covered the story. Three, including the New York Times, The Guardian and ProPublica, along with a handful of freelance journalists, included links to the leaked material online where it was posted by Anonymous for the whole world to see. The DoJ arrested and prosecuted one freelance reporter, charging him with 17 different criminal counts, all because he included the same website link that the other publications published for their readers.Protecting UBS Bank   When the DoJ was forced to sue UBS bank for defrauding its customers, AG Holder had to recuse himself because UBS was his former client when he worked at a Washington law firm.Protecting Illegal Immigrants   In 2010, the Arizona Legislature passed a law giving its State Police the authority to check the immigration status of anyone police suspected of being here illegally. The DoJ sued the state of Arizona to overturn the law, insisting it was the DoJ s privilege to enforce the country s immigration laws, not the states.Jon Corzine and MF Global Connection   Former Democratic New Jersey US Senator Jon Corzine left office to lead the financial firm MF Global, where he stole, pocketed or gambled away $1.6 billion he authorized taking from customers  bank accounts. The bank s law firm at the time was Covington & Burlington. Both AG Holder and Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer were recent employees of that firm. The DoJ chose Associate Attorney General Tony West to prosecute Corzine and MF Global. West came from the firm Morrison & Foerester, which was handling MF Global s assets at the time.DoJ Hiring Discrimination   In 2011, documents were revealed showing that AG Holder and the Justice Dept s Civil Rights Division used political litmus tests to hire employees. After President Obama s election in 2008, Holder publicly announced that the Justice Department was  going to be looking for people who share our values. FBI Assassination Plot of Occupy Wall St leaders   In 2011, two separate FBI offices   Houston and Jacksonville   published internal memos detailing a proposal to identify, photograph and assassinate Occupy Wall Street leaders using snipers. MIT students sued for the details and won. But the DoJ only turned over partial excerpts of 5 of the 17 known FBI documents on the secret project. AG Holder has refused to release the remaining documents or explain the secret assassination program at all.Lying to Congress   In 2011, the DoJ admitted to providing false testimony to Congress in their investigation of the Justice Dept and Fast and Furious.Assassinating American Citizens   With the targeted killing of Americans beginning in 2011, President Obama became the first President to order the death of an American citizen without charge, trial or conviction. He went on to assassinate an American child using the same secret targeted killing program. AG Holder not only publicly approved the President s legal authority, but personally endorsed it.Fast and Furious   In 2012, the US House voted AG Eric Holder in Contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over thousands of documents exposing the true account of the DoJ s secret gun trafficking operation which supplied over 2,000 military weapons to Mexican drug cartels. The gun-running operation began in 2009 and was run out of the Phoenix US Attorney s office along with the BATF.Protecting Mexican Drug Lords   In 2012, national media outlets confirmed that the drug lord and prime target of the DoJ s secret Fast and Furious operation, Manuel Celis-Acosta, was actually taken into custody by the Justice Dept twice during the program. But both times the DoJ released him without charges.Anti-white prosecutions   In 2013, when the violent  knockout game  trend was circulating social media, the DoJ got involved and prosecuted a perpetrator for hate crimes. But while the dozens of videoed attackers were all black and admitted targeting white victims, AG Holder found the only known white perpetrator and charged him instead.Too Big to Jail   In 2013, AG Holder testified before Congress answering America s question of why not a single banker went to jail for the criminal activity that led to the global economic collapse in 2008. He explained that Wall Street financial institutions had become too big and too important. He freely admitted that the Justice Department had its hands tied and couldn t prosecute any of the banks for fear that it would lead to their collapse and that would lead to another global financial crash.Spying on Americans   In 2012, two US Senators warned the American people that they d be horrified if they knew how President Obama and AG Holder were interpreting and executing the Patriot Act. Forbidden by law from telling America themselves, the US Senators called on the AG to declassify the DoJ s interpretation of the counter-terrorism law. AG Holder refused. The ACLU sued and the Supreme Court agreed. The DoJ still refuses.Protecting Senators Reid and Lee   In 2012, the DoJ announced it would not get involved in a criminal investigation of US Senators Harry Reid and Mike Lee. In a multi-state criminal scandal that already forced the Utah Attorney General to resign, local Republican and Democrat District Attorneys asked the DoJ for help because the two accused criminals are US Senators. AG Eric Holder refused. After ABC News broke the story, one outlet described the criminal accusations against Senators Reid and Lee as,  a massive crime ring that involves gambling, bribery, kickbacks and influence peddling. Protecting the Director of the Office of National Intelligence   In 2013, ODNI Director James Clapper testified to Congress that the NSA isn t collecting massive amounts of intelligence on all Americans as Edward Snowden s leaks revealed. He later admitted that his testimony was a lie, but that in the interest of national security, he was above the law and not answerable to Congress. A number of Congressmen called on AG Holder to charge Clapper with Contempt of Congress. Eric Holder refused.War on Medical Marijuana Patients   Even though medical marijuana is legal on the state, county and local level in 23 states and DC, the DoJ has led hundreds of military-style raids on legal medical marijuana pharmacies across the country. Rather than target drug cartels and illegal drug dealers, the DoJ has violently arrested hundreds of cancer victims, AIDS patients, dying senior citizens and war wounded.",politics,"Jul 1, 2017",Fake

Socialist Utopia of Venezuela Tells People to Eat Their Pets," GENERALLY, VENEZUELANS DO NOT EAT RABBITS AND SEE THEM AS PETS The Venezuelan government just urged its citizens to eat their pet rabbits so they won t starve to death. A severe food crisis is part of the socialist utopia that just keeps going downhill. What s next? Cannibalism?President Nicolas Maduro unveiled a government program called  Plan Rabbit  at a meeting with his agriculture minister, Freddy Bernal, that was broadcast on Periscope, CNN Money reported. It s a plan to distribute rabbits to communities across Venezuela to breed and eat. Maduro noted that rabbits breed quickly and are a good source of protein, but not cholesterol.GOVERNMENT PUSHES A  CHANGE IN CONSUMPTION PATTERNS The rabbit isn t a pet, it s only two and a half kilos of meat,  Bernal stressed in the streamed announcement. He then invoked President Donald Trump to push the program. Trump s attack against the Venezuelan people is an opportunity to revise and change cultural consumption patterns,  he said.Venezuelan opposition leaders immediately slammed the move. Are you serious?  asked former presidential candidate Henrique Capriles in a video response.  You want people to start raising rabbits to solve the problem of hunger in our country? A 2016 study found that three-fourths of Venezuelans had lost almost twenty pounds on average over the course of the year. Meat is particularly scarce in the South American nation, with citizens even resorting to butchering zoo animals, according to police.Most economists agree the mass hunger is the result of socialist government policies spearheaded by former Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez and Maduro, his successor. Chavez instituted price controls on many food items, which helped lead to shortages and massive inflation.We ve previously reported on shortages of food and even toilet paper in Venezuela.BYOTP! NO TOILET PAPER AND NO FOODSocialism doesn t work but I guess Venezuela didn t get the memo. No toilet paper? No food? Yes, it s come to that in this socialist hellhole Venezuela s product shortages have become so severe that some hotels in that country are asking guests to bring their own toilet paper and soap, a local tourism industry spokesman said on Wednesday .  It s an extreme situation,  says Xinia Camacho, owner of a 20-room boutique hotel in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada national park.  For over a year we haven t had toilet paper, soap, any kind of milk, coffee or sugar. So we have to tell our guests to come prepared.  Montilla says bigger hotels can circumvent product shortages by buying toilet paper and other basic supplies from black market smugglers who charge up to 6-times the regular price. But smaller, family-run hotels can t always afford to pay such steep prices, which means that sometimes they have to make do without.READ MORE: WFB ",Government News,"Sep 16, 2017",Fake

You should not be punished because you are working-class or poor and be denied health care. I think health care should be a right to all,  said Booker.  This is something that s got to happen.

They pay over $2 billion in taxes Is anyone else out there sick of the American people being told illegals cost nothing?DACA Will Cost Americans And Their Government A Huge Amount of Money.On average, people with college degrees pay more in taxes than they receive in government benefits. People without a degree consume more taxes than they pay to federal, state and local tax officials.In 2013, a Heritage Foundation study showed that amnesty for 11 million illegals would spike federal spending by $6,300 billion over the next five decades. That is roughly equivalent to $550,000 per illegal, or $10,000 per illegal per year, much of which will be spent when the immigrant becomes eligible for Social Security and Medicare. That cost estimate does not include the extra costs created when immigrants use their new legal powers as a citizen to bring in more low-skilled migrants.If those 3 million DACA people and their parents soon become legal residents or citizens, then Obama s DACA will cost Americans roughly $1,700 billion over the next 50 years, according to Heritage Foundation s numbers.Moreover, the DACA migrants add to the flood of illegal labor that has driven down wages for ordinary Americans, including urban youths and recent immigrants. Currently, Americans lose roughly $500 billion a year from their salaries because of the immigration tax caused by cheap labor according to the academies  report.Via: GP",Government News,"Sep 4, 2017",Fake

I m not voting in this election, so I don t have any primary endorsements at this time. The Democratic primary is Sept. 12, and de Blasio is heavily favored to win. The mayor endorsed Cuomo months before the Democratic primary in 2014.Cuomo s non-endorsement of de Blasio is just the latest example of sniping between the two Democratic Party power brokers. We didn t ask for his support,  said de Blasio campaign spokeswoman Monica Klein. A FIRESTORM OF CRITICISM If this doesn t sink the mayor s reelection efforts, we don t know what will! When de Blasio announced he would form a committee of people who would decide which statues are  offensive  then take them down, we knew it was going to be a rough go for de Blasio. You don t tell the Italian community to take down Christopher Columbus statues! Cuomo said it best when he finally came out with a statement in support of keeping the statues: The Italian American contribution and the Italian American culture is a big part if what makes New York, New York,  Cuomo said.There have been several protests regarding this move by de Blasio so he s now backtracking on his decision:Mayor de Blasio and Council Speaker Melissa Mark Viverito have come under a firestorm of criticism for mulling the removal of a Christopher Columbus statues   including the 76-foot structure in Columbus Square   as part of a review of offensive monuments. The mayor has backtracked following the outcry. There s no plan to remove the Columbus statue,  said de Blasio spokesman Eric Phillips.While the Italian explorer is revered for discovering the New World, Columbus  detractors said he mistreated and enslaved native Caribbean populations and doesn t deserve to be extolled.CUOMO NEEDED TO FIRST PUT HIS WET FINGER INTO THE WIND TO SEE HOW OPINION WAS GOINGIt s the first time Cuomo has waded in on the controversy after declining comment last week.

WOW! Rebel Media Finds Shocking Evidence Implicating Son of DEM APPOINTED Judge In â€œHate Crimeâ€ Trump Supporter Was FALSELY Charged With [VIDEO],"Rebel Media: Attacking someone for their politics could be expected from private citizens acting out against each other, but what about government and law enforcement officials?The Rebel has investigated the case of Mark Feigin, a California Trump supporter who was wrongfully accused of and charged with an anti-Muslim hate crime.On October 19, 2016, Feigin was arrested and charged with making a  criminal threat  and  annoying phone calls  against the Islamic Center of Southern California by the Los Angeles Police Department, and then by California Attorney General Kamala Harris.LAPD officers accused Feigin of making two threatening phone calls and claimed that they had traced the phone calls back to him, later labeling the calls a hate crime against Muslims.On October 19th, 2016, Feigin s home was raided by the LAPD and his weapons were confiscated and placed on display for the media during a press conference where the California Media and LAPD were complicit in portraying Feigin as a potential mass murderer.Cmdr. Horace Frank with the Los Angeles Police Department stated in a press conference in October 2016: The male caller threatened to kill the person who answered the phone along with other members of the center because of the caller s hatred for Muslims and his belief that Muslims will destroy the United States. The Rebel has obtained new documents and evidence through police disclosure surrounding the case which proves that the first phone call made to the Islamic Center came from the phone of a different California man, Michael Slawson.Michael Slawson is the son of Democratically appointed Los Angeles Superior Court Judge John Slawson.In other words, Slawson s father is a judge in the same justice system under which Feigin was charged.",Government News,"Aug 29, 2017",Fake
Is North Koreaâ€™s Kim Jong-un Considering Using 70-Year Old Biplanes to Go Undetected By Modern Radar?,"What will he think of next? Is Kim Jong-un is preparing his special forces for suicide parachute missions across the border on 70-year-old Stalin era biplanes?Footage has emerged of North Korean paratroops jumping from the aged aircraft from very low levels in a show of force.The aircraft, which were designed in 1947, have an incredibly low radar profile   meaning they are difficult to track using conventional radar. They also fly at such a slow speed that modern anti-aircraft systems are programmed to ignore their limited returns.Also, the aircraft can hug the earth meaning ground-based missile systems will not pick them up and supersonic attack jets will find difficulty in detecting them from above. The bottom of the wings and the fuselage of Kim s fleet of aircraft have been painted blue with the top of the wings is green as a form of camouflage to prevent both ground troops and aircraft spotting them. According to The Drive, the aircraft could even land on short sections of road, allowing their troops to disembark and begin a sneak attack. It is feared the old aircraft could even deliver a nuclear bomb   possibly in a suicide attack into a strategically vital location. It is believed North Korea has at least 1,000 artillery pieces within striking range of Seoul, the South Korean capital, which is home to 25 million people. Kim has claimed North Korea now has technology to miniaturise its nuclear weapons to fit onto an ballistic missile. North Korea could potentially load a bomb onto the back of an An-2   with its one-tonne cargo capacity   and detonate it over the south. Read more: Daily Mail ",Government News,"Aug 28, 2017",Fake

LT GEN JOHN KELLYâ€™S INCREDIBLE SPEECH Just Days After His Own Son Was Killed In Action: â€œBrave Men On Watch All Over the World Tonightâ€”For YOUâ€,"Just days after the death of his own son in combat, Lt Gen John Kelly eulogized two other sons in an unforgettable manner:Two years ago when I was the Commander of all U.S. and Iraqi forces, in fact, the 22nd of April 2008, two Marine infantry battalions, 1/9  The Walking Dead,  and 2/8 were switching out in Ramadi. One battalion in the closing days of their deployment going home very soon, the other just starting its seven-month combat tour.Two Marines, Corporal Jonathan Yale and Lance Corporal Jordan Haerter, 22 and 20 years old respectively, one from each battalion, were assuming the watch together at the entrance gate of an outpost that contained a makeshift barracks housing 50 Marines.The same broken down ramshackle building was also home to 100 Iraqi police, also my men and our allies in the fight against the terrorists in Ramadi, a city until recently the most dangerous city on earth and owned by Al Qaeda. Yale was a dirt poor mixed-race kid from Virginia with a wife and daughter, and a mother and sister who lived with him and he supported as well. He did this on a yearly salary of less than $23,000. Haerter, on the other hand, was a middle class white kid from Long Island.They were from two completely different worlds. Had they not joined the Marines they would never have met each other, or understood that multiple America s exist simultaneously depending on one s race, education level, economic status, and where you might have been born. But they were Marines, combat Marines, forged in the same crucible of Marine training, and because of this bond they were brothers as close, or closer, than if they were born of the same woman.The mission orders they received from the sergeant squad leader I am sure went something like:  Okay you two clowns, stand this post and let no unauthorized personnel or vehicles pass.   You clear?  I am also sure Yale and Haerter then rolled their eyes and said in unison something like:  Yes Sergeant,  with just enough attitude that made the point without saying the words,  No kidding sweetheart, we know what we re doing.  They then relieved two other Marines on watch and took up their post at the entry control point of Joint Security Station Nasser, in the Sophia section of Ramadi, al Anbar, Iraq.A few minutes later a large blue truck turned down the alley way perhaps 60-70 yards in length and sped its way through the serpentine of concrete jersey walls. The truck stopped just short of where the two were posted and detonated, killing them both catastrophically. Twenty-four brick masonry houses were damaged or destroyed. A mosque 100 yards away collapsed. The truck s engine came to rest two hundred yards away knocking most of a house down before it stopped.Our explosive experts reckoned the blast was made of 2,000 pounds of explosives. Two died, and because these two young infantrymen didn t have it in their DNA to run from danger, they saved 150 of their Iraqi and American brothers-in-arms.When I read the situation report about the incident a few hours after it happened I called the regimental commander for details as something about this struck me as different. Marines dying or being seriously wounded is commonplace in combat. We expect Marines regardless of rank or MOS to stand their ground and do their duty, and even die in the process, if that is what the mission takes. But this just seemed different.The regimental commander had just returned from the site and he agreed, but reported that there were no American witnesses to the event just Iraqi police. I figured if there was any chance of finding out what actually happened and then to decorate the two Marines to acknowledge their bravery, I d have to do it as a combat award that requires two eye-witnesses and we figured the bureaucrats back in Washington would never buy Iraqi statements. If it had any chance at all, it had to come under the signature of a general officer.I traveled to Ramadi the next day and spoke individually to a half-dozen Iraqi police all of whom told the same story. The blue truck turned down into the alley and immediately sped up as it made its way through the serpentine. They all said,  We knew immediately what was going on as soon as the two Marines began firing.  The Iraqi police then related that some of them also fired, and then to a man, ran for safety just prior to the explosion.All survived. Many were injured   some seriously. One of the Iraqis elaborated and with tears welling up said,  They d run like any normal man would to save his life. What he didn t know until then, he said, and what he learned that very instant, was that Marines are not normal. Choking past the emotion he said,  Sir, in the name of God no sane man would have stood there and done what they did. No sane man. They saved us all. What we didn t know at the time, and only learned a couple of days later after I wrote a summary and submitted both Yale and Haerter for posthumous Navy Crosses, was that one of our security cameras, damaged initially in the blast, recorded some of the suicide attack. It happened exactly as the Iraqis had described it. It took exactly six seconds from when the truck entered the alley until it detonated.You can watch the last six seconds of their young lives. Putting myself in their heads I supposed it took about a second for the two Marines to separately come to the same conclusion about what was going on once the truck came into their view at the far end of the alley. Exactly no time to talk it over, or call the sergeant to ask what they should do. Only enough time to take half an instant and think about what the sergeant told them to do only a few minutes before:     let no unauthorized personnel or vehicles pass. The two Marines had about five seconds left to live. It took maybe another two seconds for them to present their weapons, take aim, and open up. By this time the truck was half-way through the barriers and gaining speed the whole time. Here, the recording shows a number of Iraqi police, some of whom had fired their AKs, now scattering like the normal and rational men they were some running right past the Marines. They had three seconds left to live.For about two seconds more, the recording shows the Marines  weapons firing non-stop the truck s windshield exploding into shards of glass as their rounds take it apart and tore in to the body of the son-of-a-bitch who is trying to get past them to kill their brothers American and Iraqi bedded down in the barracks totally unaware of the fact that their lives at that moment depended entirely on two Marines standing their ground. If they had been aware, they would have know they were safe   because two Marines stood between them and a crazed suicide bomber.The recording shows the truck careening to a stop immediately in front of the two Marines. In all of the instantaneous violence Yale and Haerter never hesitated. By all reports and by the recording, they never stepped back. They never even started to step aside. They never even shifted their weight. With their feet spread shoulder width apart, they leaned into the danger, firing as fast as they could work their weapons. They had only one second left to live.The truck explodes. The camera goes blank. Two young men go to their God.Six seconds.Not enough time to think about their families, their country, their flag, or about their lives or their deaths, but more than enough time for two very brave young men to do their duty   into eternity. That is the kind of people who are on watch all over the world tonight for you. ",Government News,"Aug 25, 2017",Fake

AIRPORT PASSENGER â€œPAT DOWNSâ€ Get More Intrusive With New Full-Body Groping Procedures,"One woman s awful experience at the airport could soon be what we all go through to travel by air. This is the day of terrorism where Islamists will do pretty much anything to hide explosives or a weapon so we now have to endure a very  intimate  examination in order to keep us all safe when flying. The new procedure was put in place a month ago-Please see the specifics below.Do you have a story to tell? We d like to hear it. Here s Jenna s story below:Jenna MacFarlane was on the way to visit a friend in Baltimore in April when her carry-on bag triggered an alarm at Charlotte s airport.A Transportation Security Administration screener told MacFarlane she would have to undergo a full-body pat-down by a female officer. Late for her flight and with no option other than to be searched in private, MacFarlane agreed.The pat-down, done over her clothes, explored her breasts, crotch and buttocks. I did not imagine that she would ask me a few times to spread my legs wider and in fact touch my vagina four times with the side of her hand,  MacFarlane later wrote in a complaint to the TSA.Just a month before her search, TSA had launched a new,  more involved  pat-down procedure:Pat-down procedures are used to determine whether prohibited items or other threats to transportation security are concealed on the person. You may be required to undergo a pat-down procedure if the screening technology alarms, as part of random or unpredictable security measures, for enhanced screening, or as an alternative to other types of screening, such as advanced imaging technology screening. Even passengers who normally receive expedited screening, such as TSA Pre  passengers, may at times receive a pat-down.A pat-down may include inspection of the head, neck, arms, torso, legs, and feet. This includes head coverings and sensitive areas such as breasts, groin, and the buttocks. You may be required to adjust clothing during the pat-down. The officer will advise you of the procedure to help you anticipate any actions before you feel them. Pat-downs require sufficient pressure to ensure detection, and areas may undergo a pat-down more than once for the TSA officer to confirm no threat items are detected.TSA officers use the back of the hands for pat-downs over sensitive areas of the body. In limited cases, additional screening involving a sensitive area pat-down with the front of the hand may be needed to determine that a threat does not exist.You will receive a pat-down by an officer of the same gender. TSA officers will explain the procedures to you as they conduct the pat-down. Please inform an officer if you have difficulty raising your arms or remaining in the position required; an external medical device; or areas of the body that are painful when touched. You may request a chair to sit if needed.At any time during the process, you may request private screening accompanied by a companion of your choice. A second officer of the same gender will always be present during private screening.Read more here: Charlotte Observer",Government News,"Aug 23, 2017",Fake
â€œDIRTY JOBSâ€ HOST MIKE ROWE Absolutely Destroys Guy Who Called Him A White Nationalist," Dirty Jobs  host Mike Rowe went off on a guy who claimed Rowe is a  white nationalist . The usual happy-go-lucky Rowe was clearly ticked when he wrote back to Chuck Adkins.Chuck Adkins asked Rowe:  One of the tenants of white nationalism is that college educated people are academic elitists. Comment? No? I m not surprised. You never take a political stand because you don t want to alienate anybody. Its bad for business. I get it. But there is a current of anti intellectualism in this country   promoted by Republicans. Those people love you, and they think your initiative is their initiative. Meanwhile, the rest of the world is kickin our ass academically. Rowe responded with a blistering rebuke of Adkins and the liberal media: Since we re being candid, allow me to say how much I dislike your post. Everything about it annoys me   your smug and snarky tone, your appalling grammar, your complete lack of evidence to support your claims, and of course, the overarching logical fallacy that informs your entire position,  Rowe wrote.  What really bugs me though, is the fact that you re not entirely wrong. It s true; I haven t shared any political opinions this week, in part anyway, because doing so might very well be  bad for business. What can I say? I work for half-a-dozen different companies, none of whom pay me to share my political opinions. I run a non-partisan foundation, I m about to launch a new show on Facebook, and I m very aware that celebrities pay a price for opening their big fat gobs. Gilbert Gottfried, Kathy Griffin, Colin Kaepernick, Milo Yiannopoulos even that guy from Google who just got himself fired for mouthing off. There s no getting around it   the first amendment does not guarantee the freedom to speak without consequences. And really, that s fine by me,  he continued. So no   I m not going to share my personal feelings about Charlottesville, President Trump, or the current effort to remove thousands of statues of long dead soldiers from the public square. Not just because it s  bad for business,  but because it s annoying. I can t think of a single celebrity whose political opinion I value, and I m not going to assume the country feels any differently about mine,  Rowe wrote.  So, rather than blow myself up, or chime in with all the obvious observations about the cowardly scum in the pointy hats, I m going to talk instead about my belief that comments like yours pose a far greater threat to the future of our country than the existence of a memorial to Thomas Jefferson, or a monument to George Washington. Ready? Then Rowe started in on Adkins  insinuations. You say that White Nationalists believe that everyone who goes to college is an  academic elite.  You then say that Republicans promote  anti-intellectualism.  You offer no proof to support either claim, but it really doesn t matter   your statements successfully connect two radically different organizations by alleging a shared belief,  Rowe said.  Thus, White Nationalists and The Republican Party suddenly have something in common   a contempt for higher education. Then, you make it personal. You say that Republicans  love  me because they believe that my initiative and  their  initiative are one and the same. But of course,  their  initiative is now the same initiative as White Nationalists. He continued  Very clever. Without offering a shred of evidence, you ve implied that Republicans who support mikeroweWORKS do so because they believe I share their disdain for all things  intellectual.  And poof   just like that, Republicans, White Nationalists, and mikeroweWORKS are suddenly conflated, and the next thing you know, I m off on a press tour to disavow rumors of my troubling association with the Nazis! Far-fetched? Far from it,  Rowe continued.  That s how logical fallacies work. A flaw in reasoning or a mistaken belief undermines the logic of a conclusion, often leading to real-world consequences. And right now, logical fallacies are not limited to the warped beliefs of morons with tiki torches, and other morons calling for  more dead cops.  Logical fallacies are everywhere. Not near done, Rowe wrote,  As I type this, a Democrat on CNN is making an argument that says,  because Thomas Jefferson owned slaves, those Republicans now opposed to tearing down his memorial are  pro-slavery,  and therefore aligned with the modern day KKK.  That s a logical fallacy. Over on Fox, a Republican is arguing that  any Democrat who has not yet condemned the Senator from Missouri for publicly wishing that Donald Trump be assassinated, is guilty of wishing for the exact same thing.  That s a logical fallacy. Yesterday, on The Science Channel, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, a noted astronomer, tweeted that the ability of scientists to accurately predict the solar eclipse, was proof that predictions of global warming were also accurate. That s a logical fallacy. Then Rowe turned the tables on his accuser, continuing,  Want to hear another one? Imagine something like this, unfolding over on MSNBC. Good Evening, America, our top story tonight  Chuck Atkins is a racist! Why? Because he can t spell. Just look at his grammar! In a recent post on Mike Rowe s Facebook page, Mr. Atkins, while bemoaning America s global academic standing, not only misspelled  elitist,  he used  tenants  when he meant  tenets.  He neglected to use a hyphen in  anti-intellectual,  and he misplaced several commas and apostrophes! But why is he a racist, you ask? Simple. Because everyone knows racists are ignorant. Chuck Atkins is clearly a poor speller. Poor spelling and grammar are signs of ignorance. Ergo   Chuck Atkins is a racist! Boom! The matter is settled! There s not much we can do about the news, but here on Facebook, I think we can do better. This isn t Twitter,  Rowe said.  We re not limited to a few inflammatory sentences and a flurry of emojis. Take a moment, Chuck. Think. Make a rational argument. Otherwise, just link us to a cat video. People love those, and they re almost never  bad for business.  (Unless of course, the cat gets hurt. People hate that.) Just don t assume that people will care about your beliefs, if you re not willing to back them up with some relevant facts and a rational conclusion. Here, for instance, are a few facts that matter to me, with respect to my foundation and the recurring charge of  fostering anti-intellectualism. Rowe then defended his charitable work, writing,  mikeroweWORKS is a PR campaign for the skilled trades. For the last nine years, we ve partnered with numerous trade schools, raised millions of dollars for work-ethic scholarships, and called attention to millions of jobs that don t require a four-year degree. But that doesn t mean we re  anti-intellectual.  We re not even  anti-college.  We simply reject the popular notion that a four-year degree is the best path for the most people. And we re hardly alone. Millions of reasonable people   Republicans and Democrats alike   are worried that our universities are doing a poor job of preparing students for the real world. They re worried about activist professors, safe spaces, the rising cost of tuition, a growing contempt for history, and a simmering disregard of the first amendment. These people are concerned that our universities   once beacons of free speech   now pander to a relatively small percentage of students who can t tolerate any political opinion that challenges their own. And they re concerned   deeply concerned   that millions of good jobs are currently vacant that don t require a four-year degree, or any of the catastrophic debt that comes with it. Returning to the original attack, Rowe concluded,  Again   these are not the concerns of  anti-intellectuals.  They are the concerns of people who care about the future of the country. I don t know how many of these people are Republicans, but I can assure you that no one who actually supports my initiative is remotely confused about my feelings on education, because I ve been crystal clear on that topic from the very beginning. To quote Thomas Jefferson, (while I still can,)  If a nation expects to be ignorant and free and live in a state of civilization, it expects what never was and never will be.  On this point, my foundation does not equivocate. In other words, Chuck, I have no idea what The White Nationalists think about my efforts, or the Republicans, the Democrats, the elitists, the Italians, the Presbyterians, the unions, or the self-proclaimed anti-intellectuals. And really, I couldn t care less. My question is, why do you? Mike PS. Ok, I ve just re-read this, (in a desperate search for typos,) and I want to apologize for pointing out that you re a lousy speller. This is probably not the time to trot out The Grammar Nazi, but your tenor and tone pissed me off, and I responded in my own snarky way. Sorry,  he wrote. PPS Maybe this is how political correctness begins? Maybe we start by correcting each other s grammar, and then move on to the business of correcting everything else? Today a missing hyphen, tomorrow a missing monument. Or, maybe not,  he concluded.",Government News,"Aug 23, 2017",Fake

VICE MAGAZINE CALLS FOR ISIS-LIKE DESTRUCTION: â€œLetâ€™s Blow Up Mount Rushmoreâ€,"It is becoming increasingly difficult to separate leftists from Islamic terrorists as both destroy monuments, statues, and seek to eliminate freedoms we enjoy. On a day in which an Islamic terrorist killed over a dozen people in Barcelona, senior editor Wilber Cooper has the audacity to publish an article for VICE Magazine urging the left to destroy Mt. Rushmore just like ISIS would.In his article  Let s Blow Up Mount Rushmore,  Cooper attacks the Founding Fathers and calls for a demolition of the monument. His call to erase historical markers, such as statues, echoes the recent movement from left-wingers for a culture war that would decimate Americans  political traditions and heroes. Those targeted heroes include Thomas Jefferson, former president and chief author of the Bill of Rights   such as the First Amendment   and General and President George Washington, who declined offers to become a dictator after winning the Revolutionary War.Cooper argues that these historical monuments and statues help preserve a system of racial exploitation and inequality, and should be erased to help build a new society. He says,  It s going to be impossible to improve America if we can t be honest about its origins and its past. He insists that  Trump and his white supremacist cohorts believe the reverence some Americans have for these statues is simply respect for history, and that tearing them down is tantamount to ripping pages out of a textbook. But monuments built by the state are not history they are manifestations of power. Upon acknowledging the insensitivity of the article s title given the tragic events which occurred earlier today in Spain, VICE Magazine deleted the original article and wrote an editor s note:  The headline and URL of this story have been updated. We do not condone violence in any shape or form, and the use of  blow up  in the original headline as a rhetorical device was misguided and insensitive. We apologize for the error. They have since changed the title to  Get Rid of Mount Rushmore.  Wow. What an improvement. Leftists continue to contradict their self-proclaimed peace-seeking objectives and prove that they are actually seeking to burn down the United States by getting rid of every trace of this great country s history. And you can bet they are coming for the Constitution next.Read more: Breitbart",Government News,"Aug 17, 2017",Fake
ATLANTA JUDGE Punished for Telling the Truth About Radical Antifa Protesters â€œTearing Down Monumentsâ€,"And once again, the snowflakes want to erase parts of history they know nothing about. And what s more, they attack and penalize those who try to defend it.This week, an Atlanta judge was suspended upon posting his thoughts about Confederate monuments and so called  anti-fascist  protesters on Facebook. Judge James Hinkle wrote,  It looks like all of the snowflakes have no concept of history. It is what it is. Get over it and move on.  He went on to add,  The nut cases tearing down monuments are equivalent to ISIS destroying history. ISIS AND ANTIFA BELOW- BOTH HATE AMERICA AND DEAL WITH CONFLICT BY USING VIOLENCE AND DESTRUCTION.He noted that, Confederate monuments in Virginia have the rear ends of horses facing north. Following these posts, Hinkle was told by Gwinnett County s chief magistrate that he was suspended. Chief Judge Kristina Blum released the following statement:  I have made it clear to all of our judges to conduct themselves in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity, impartiality, and fairness of the judiciary. I consider any violation of those principles and policies to be a matter of utmost concern. Hinkle, who also served as the mayor of Grayson for over twenty years, previously made his views well known on social media when he posted he was  proud to be a deplorable infidel.  While many have been calling for his permanent removal, Hinkle has stated that he did not see what he did wrong.

THE PURGE: NYC Mayor De Blasio to Review â€˜All Symbols of Hateâ€ on City Property,"THE PURGE CONTINUES THE NYC MAYOR has just opened a can of worms so big that it ll be hard to control it. He wants to review  all symbols of hate  on city property then leave it to his panel of  experts  to decide what stays and what goes. This should be interesting. Isn t this subjective? Someone might think one thing is a symbol of hate but not another. Where does this purging end?Mayor de Blasio said late Wednesday that the city will conduct a 90-day review of  all symbols of hate on city property  in the wake of violence sparked by white supremacist groups in Charlottesville, Virginia over the weekend.A 32-year-old woman was killed and more than a dozen people were injured when a vehicle slammed into a group of counter-protesters on Saturday, and two state troopers died when the helicopter from which they were monitoring events suddenly crashed.Opposition to the removal of a statue of Confederate Army general Robert E. Lee was at the heart of rallies by white nationalists and KKK members in Charlottesville this year.New York City officials said they re putting together a panel of  relevant experts and community leaders  who will define the criteria and make recommendations for which items to remove.EXPERTS? WHO SAYS?MEANWHILE IN THE EAST VILLAGEThe South is rising   in the East Village.Residents are seeing red over a pair of Confederate flags hanging in the window of an East 8th Street apartment building, following the deadly white power rally in Virginia this week.The flags have been hanging in the fifth-floor window of the building near the corner of Avenue D for months, but anger is boiling over in the aftermath of the weekend s carnage   with neighbors pelting rocks and bricks at the window Wednesday morning. They re scary, we don t know who we are dealing with in the neighborhood. I feel uncomfortable because that represents evil. I see the protests in the news and I come home and see this,  said local Louise Abddhal, 56, as a chorus of others yelled at the window.Residents had turned a blind eye to the offensive banners in the past, but started getting mad after Saturday s rally in Charlottesville, where a neo-Nazi fatally mowed down counter-protester Heather Hayer. It s been there forever and no one said anything. Now it s going crazy. Virginia is bringing more light and attention too,  said longtime resident Janet Brown. .The Dixie-head has changed the flags around several times   there was a  neo-Nazi  one for awhile, according to Brown   and he now has two Israeli flags and an American flag between the Confederate ones.But the baffling collection is just making residents angrier. He is a Jew with a Confederate flag! Are you kidding me?  said one neighbor, who wouldn t give his name. Confederate flags in the window, bro! That is a bunch of racists. Right here in the avenue, bro! In the hood! This sh-t is real. He is looking to start a f ing riot. The building s property manager said he s aware of the flags and is trying to get the resident to take them down.Footage of a man throwing rocks and screaming expletives at the windows on Wednesday morning shows police arriving and telling him to stop   but witnesses say cops didn t make any arrests.Via: NYP",Government News,"Aug 16, 2017",Fake

We re hoping Sessions digs deep! If AG Jeff Sessions doesn t dig deep ASAP to uncover Soros  involvement in Antifa and BLM, then this Soros-funded war will continue. We need a fighter to win the battle against this evil Hungarian globalist!Liberal billionaire George Soros s advocacy arm is ramping up its lobbying efforts this year, disclosure forms show.SOROS WANTS OPEN BORDERS AND GLOBALISM:The amount Soros spent on lobbying shot up to $11 million in 2013, a drastic increase from the $3.4 million the group had spent in 2012. The uptick could be attributed to the group s push for  comprehensive immigration reform  during this time.The Open Society Policy Center, a D.C.-based nonprofit that focuses on advocacy efforts and is a separate entity from the Soros grant making Open Society Foundations, has spent nearly as much on lobbying in the first half of 2017 as the group did in the entirety of 2016.The Open Society Policy Center reported spending $4.6 million in the first and second quarters, which runs from Jan. 1 to June 30, according its disclosure forms filed to the House of Representatives and the Senate.THREE IN-HOUSE LOBBYISTS? The group has three in-house lobbyists who lobby the U.S. Senate, House of Representatives, National Security Council, the Department of Defense, and the Department of State.Soros even  tried to influence the decision of the Supreme court on immigration according to The Daily Caller:Open Society Foundations, Hungarian-born billionaire George Soros  stated vehicle for progressive social change, orchestrated a well-funded attempt to secure a desired outcome in a U.S. Supreme Court case on illegal immigration enforcement, according to a newly discovered memo between the organization s top U.S. officials and board members.Soros drastically extended the policy scope of his lobbying efforts as the year progressed, including to issues that have been seen as a direct strike against the Hungarian-born billionaire.IF HUNGARY (SOROS  HOME COUNTRY) CAN TRY AND BAN HIS GOV T INTERFERENCE, WHY CAN T WE?From January to March, Soros s group lobbied on three issues. From April to June, the group lobbied 17 different issues, including the Bill on Foreign Funded Organizations in Hungary (LexNGo), Hungary s crack down on foreign-funded organizations in the country.Hungary s parliament approved the law that targets foreign-funded organizations in June, which they have said  can threaten the country s political and economic interests and interfere with the functioning of its institutions,  according to text of the law.Although the law does not mention Soros by name, politicians in Hungary previously said they wanted to  sweep out  organizations tied to Soros.Soros s Open Society Foundations has given money to a number of prominent NGOs in Hungary. The group has said that the country s bill  seeks to suppress democratic voices in Hungary. The lobbyists also worked on issues such as the Restricting First Use of Nuclear Weapons Act of 2017 and the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2018, among others.Soros s lobbying efforts have quietly skyrocketed in recent years.The policy center reported spending $19,120,000 on lobbying for policy and legislative efforts with Congress and government agencies between 2002 and 2012, which averages out to $1.9 million per year.WE HAD A PUPPET MASTER PULLING THE STRINGS IN THE WHITE HOUSE FOR 8 YEARS!

HERE YOU GO! TRUMP CONDEMNS DAVID DUKEâ€¦Calls Him A â€œBigotâ€ and A â€œRacistâ€ [Video],"Following the situation in Charlottesville, Trump was one of the very few people to call out all sides for displays of violence and bigotry: white supremacists, black supremacists, Communists, and Antifa. In short, this flurry of frustration was far from one-sided.Amidst all of the chaos, David Duke tried to link Trump to the bigotry and violence that was present in Charlottesville. This is certainly interesting considering the fact that Trump called Duke out on his own bigotry nearly seventeen years ago. In an interview with Matt Lauer in 2000, Trump condemned Duke while being questioned about his reasons for dropping out of the Reform Party primary.Trump attributed the party s  self-destructing  nature to the people involved with it, specifically Duke. When pressed on this matter by Lauer, Trump responded,  Well, you ve got David Duke just joined, a bigot, a racist, a problem, I mean, this is not exactly the people you want in your party.

"ACLU DEFENDS ILLEGALS? SUES DOJ, ICE Over Arrests of Illegal Alien Teen Gangs: â€œThat was play-fightingâ€","WHO IS THE ACLU PROTECTING? Certainly not the legal citizens of America!After Obama allowed and even encouraged thousands upon thousands of unaccompanied illegal alien minors to flood America, we re now responsible for the mess he created.  MS13 gang members have been going on killing sprees that have been terrorizing Americans. President Trump has a policy in place that simply enforces the law! Read below and let us know if you agree that the ACLU is protecting people who should have no rights in America.The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed a class action lawsuit against President Trump s administration over the detention of immigrant teenagers for  unsubstantiated claims of gang affiliation. The lawsuit, announced on Friday, targets Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Department of Health and Human Services  Office of Refugee Resettlement.In a press release, the ACLU accuses ICE and the Office of Refugee Resettlement of detaining children and transporting them to detention facilities without notifying their parents or lawyers.The organization also alleges that ICE is detaining and deporting the immigrant teens  under the guise of a  crackdown  on transnational street gangs  and accuses the federal agency of making arrests based on  unreliable claims of gang affiliation and flawed reports of criminal history.   We re talking about teens who were picked up for play-fighting with a friend, or for showing pride in their home country of El Salvador,  Stephen Kang, an attorney with the ACLU Immigrants  Rights Project, said in the release.  The Office of Refugee Resettlement is accepting wholesale that young immigrants should be kept behind bars because of what they look like or where they come from. The lead plaintiffs in the case are from Suffolk County in Long Island, N.Y.In May, ICE announced it has arrested more than 1,300 people in a crackdown on gangs. Three of those arrested had Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals paperwork protecting them from deportation, according to a report at the time by The Washington Post.The crackdown on gangs coupled with the Trump administration s tough stance on legal and illegal immigration has raised alarms among activists that people with tenuous connections to gangs could come under unfair scrutiny.Fox News reported a surge in people seeking to remove tattoos that people believed could be used by ICE to link them to gangs.The ACLU class action lawsuit seeks the release of the teens who are the plaintiffs in the case as well as an injunction to prevent the government from further detaining immigrant children without cause.The ACLU has launched numerous lawsuits against Trump s administration since he took office, suing over Trump s travel ban and challenging the legality of his voter fraud commission.WHO IS THE ACLU PROTECTING?

UPDATE ON 9/11 MEMORIAL Banned for â€œTriggeringâ€ College Snowflakes,"Great news! Southern Methodist University in Texas has reversed its decision to relocate an annual 9/11 memorial display made up of nearly 3,000 American flags to a less prominent part of campus after facing backlash from student groups.A huge thank you to The Young Americans for Freedom group! They had a hand in making this happen! They also were the ones who had set up the tribute honoring the victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on SMU s Dallas Hall Lawn every year since 2010.But in July officials informed the group to move the display to Morrison-McGinnis Park because Dallas Hall Lawn is used for classes and a variety of events, said university spokesman Kent Best.SMU officials also had adopted a policy to ensure displays didn t include  harmful or triggering  messages, but they later removed the language from the then-policy as inappropriate. By that time, though, some student groups said the new policy was an attack on free speech. I don t believe it s the responsibility of the university to shield individuals from certain ideas that they might be offended by,  said Grant Wolf, the leader of the Young Americans for Freedom group, according to Dallas News. Wolf, along with other leaders from campus groups, sent a letter to university President R. Gerald Turner to express their frustration with the policy.  People absolutely have to have a right to their own opinions, but this does not come with a right to be shielded from opposing ideas, especially in an environment dedicated to the learning, sharing and developing of new ideas,  they wrote.They decried the relocation of the memorial. Moving the 9/11 memorial to an out of the way park is almost the same as not allowing it, said Heather Hall, president of the university s Turning Point USA chapter.  That s not free speech,  Hall said.  That s not American. That s definitely not what SMU stands for.   Read more:  Daily MailOUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THIS BAN: The shocker about this is that students on both sides of the political spectrum want the 9/11 flags to be displayed where they ve always been displayed. The inability of college campuses to stand up to people who are perpetually offended is a sad statement on where we are in American tolerance these days. It s so ironic that the left wants you to march to their drum beat or else they will destroy you. Note to SMU: You had a good thing going with your student body coming together to memorialize 9/11 so let it continue!DALLAS, Tex.   In a time of extreme political divide, students both Republican and Democrat at one Texas college have found something they can agree on.For the past two years at Southern Methodist University, a campus group has planted thousands of American flags in front of Dallas Hall as a memorial to the victims of the 9/11 attacks. That s simply contradictory to the very definition of free speech,  said Grant Wolf, the Young Americans for Freedom Chairman.But in July, SMU changed its policy, saying student groups can no longer have displays there.The lawn has historically hosted tributes and protests from students of all political affiliations. The leaders of two prominent student groups say the policy violates their right to free speech. They re basically cornering us into a segment of campus and saying you re not allowed to have a display here because it s triggering, harmful or offensive to students over there,  said Drew Wicker, the President of SMU College Republicans.SMU released a statement saying nearby Momac Park, where displays will be allowed, is larger than the lawn and is along one of the most prominent drives on campus.The university said it  respects the rights of all campus community members to express their opinions, as well as their right to be free from coercion or harassment.

FEDERAL JUDGE Just Delivered Bad News to Hillary Clinton About the Missing Benghazi Emails,"Great news! A federal judge just ordered the State Department to make another attempt at locating Hillary Clinton s missing emails about the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attack. The interesting thing is that the judge is an Obama appointee who ruled with Judicial Watch. DIDN T DO ENOUGH .U.S. District Court Judge Amit Mehta ruled Tuesday that the State Department did not do enough to  track down messages Clinton may have sent about the assault on the U.S. diplomatic compound on Sept. 11, 2012   an attack that killed four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador to Libya,  Politico reported:In response to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, State searched the roughly 30,000 messages Clinton turned over to her former agency at its request in December 2014 after officials searching for Benghazi-related records realized she had used a personal email account during her four-year tenure as secretary.State later searched tens of thousands of emails handed over to the agency by three former top aides to Clinton: Huma Abedin, Cheryl Mills and Jake Sullivan. Finally, State searched a collection of emails the FBI assembled when it was investigating Clinton s use of the private account and server.In all, State found 348 Benghazi-related messages or documents that were sent to or from Clinton in a period of nearly five months after the attack.Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog group, said the State Department s initial search was not good enough because it didn t search the email accounts of Clinton s top aides for relevant messages pertaining to Benghazi.Mehta, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, agreed with Judicial Watch in a 10-page ruling. To date, State has searched only data compilations originating from outside sources   Secretary Clinton, her former aides, and the FBI.   It has not, however, searched the one records system over which it has always had control and that is almost certain to contain some responsive records: the state.gov e-mail server,  Mehta wrote.",Government News,"Aug 10, 2017",Fake
WOW! ATLANTA GYM OWNER BANS COPSâ€¦Makes â€˜No Apologiesâ€™ For Policy or Sign (Video),"It s one thing to have the media constantly painting police officers in a bad light on a near daily basis. But it s entirely another thing to have civilians discriminating against them on completely illegitimate grounds. This is exactly what happened this week when Jim Chambers, owner of the EAV Barbell Club in Atlanta, posted a sign on the front of his gym forbidding police officers.The message that the sign conveys alone is upsetting. But the expletives included make it an even more shocking and vulgar. While the sign is no longer posted on his gym s door, Chambers continue to stand by it. We ve had an explicitly stated  No Cop  policy since we opened, and we also don t open membership to active members of the military,  he said.As a lifelong political activist, Chamber says that his sign and policy serves as a political statement. He says groups who work out there are generally minorities who are uncomfortable with the presence of law enforcement agents. Chambers claimed that if any police officials had a warrant, they could do their job but that he is  not breaking the law. Chambers insists that they never have, and won t ever need the help of officers. He plans to put the  No Cop  sign back up without the foul language.When asked to comment, lawyers found the policy strange, but said because law enforcement officers are not a protected class under the law, only the courts can decide if EAV Barbell Club is violating any anti-discrimination laws. When asked to comment on the incident, the Atlanta Police Department stated,  Were we to respond to an emergency there, this sign would not stop us from lawfully doing our job.

This retired Marine hit the jackpot by finding a way to keep himself entertained and fit during retirement: trolling New York liberals by boat.Nearly every day, Dion Cini will row down the Hudson River while flying a  Trump 2020  flag to incite the frustration of New Yorkers, a group who overwhelmingly voted for Hillary Clinton this past election.This retired Marine can t get enough of the responses he gets from people who spot him rowing around Manhattan. Sometimes you hear  I hope you get hit by a boat! I hope you drown!  he said.  From the top of their lungs as loud as they can. It can be from the edge of the river. It can be from cars driving by on the river. It can be from windows. I get it all the time and then I get it even on rooftop bars. Cini calls himself an  ultra-conservative  and thinks that Americans need a  wake-up call.   He said,  I call it tough love. (President) Trump is tough love. Cini recalled being told to leave Washington Square Park with his flag because it was  not conservative land  but he vowed that no one would stop him.Luckily, these angry New Yorkers haven t swayed Cini one bit. He s considering getting a bigger flag spanning twenty feet. And a bigger boat. Despite his retirement, it s inspiring to see that this Marine s devotion to patriotism hasn t wavered.Read more: BizPac Review",Government News,"Aug 9, 2017",Fake
FLASHBACK: TRUMP PLANS STRATEGY Against North Korea In â€™99 Interview [Video],"There is no debating the fact that tensions between the United States and North Korea have reached a boiling point. But what s still being continuously debated is how to handle these tensions.President Trump threatened to use  fire and fury  against North Korea after it was revealed that North Korea successfully created a miniaturized nuclear weapon designed to fit inside its missiles. In an interview with NBC s Tim Russert in 1999, then businessman Donald Trump voiced his support for a pre-emptive military strike against North Korea.Trump told Russert that if he was President, a Trump administration would  negotiate like crazy  to  get the best deal possible.  If a deal was not possible, Trump said he would order a pre-emptive strike. He went on to successfully predict that that they re [North Korea] are going to have those weapons pointed all over the world and specifically at the United States.  He goes further by saying that it only does the U.S. minimal good to discuss the economy and Social Security without addressing the biggest problem: nuclear proliferation. He also calls out previous politicians   including Jimmy Carter   for not facing this situation head on and negotiating properly.Following President Trump s warning North Korea over further provocations, the Hermit Kingdom has announced it is considering striking Guam. The North Korean military warned it may carry out a preemptive operation once the US shows signs of provocation , and that it is seriously considering a strategy to strike Guam with mid-to-long range missiles. As Trump moves forward, this interview serves as evidence that his strategy will hold up against North Korea.Read more: The Gateway Pundit",Government News,"Aug 8, 2017",Fake
BURN! SEBASTIAN GORKA HUMILIATES MSNBC On Use of â€˜Radical Islamic Terrorismâ€™ [Video],"It s probably not the wisest decision to argue with Dr. Sebastian Gorka about the use of the phrase  radical Islamic terrorism    especially if you have absolutely no idea what you re talking about in the first place.Dr. Sebastian Gorka defended the Trump administration s use of the phrase  radical Islamic terrorism  in an appearance on MSNBC Tuesday. We will call it  radical Islamic terrorism. We will target the ideology, and we will call them out for being evil,  Gorka stated. MSNBC s Ali Velshi and Stephanie Ruhle then tried to criticize Gorka s use of the phrase.Velshi asked Gorka how it would help stop terror attacks if the White House called the problem  radical Islamic terrorism. Gorka then engaged a clever metaphor to help them understand. Gorka argued,  If you, God forbid, caught cancer, and the hospital was forbidden from calling it cancer and said,  You have the flu. Go home and hydrate and take some aspirins, would you actually have the right treatment?.' Ruhle responded, smugly, that there s still no cure for cancer and that it doesn t matter what you call it if it will still kill you.Velshi then accused Gorka of not having a good answer. Gorka fired back by saying that if you misdiagnose anything, whether it s a serious disease or a serious international geopolitical threat, you will never solve it. The White House Adviser then criticized the Obama administration for blaming this geopolitical issue on economic conditions and societal disenfranchisement It is about people having an ideology that is evil, and it has to be destroyed.

WHY THE HUGE 1.1 MILLION DROP in Food Stamp Enrollment? [VIDEO],"OVER 1 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE DROPPED OFF OF THE FOOD STAMP LISTS GREAT NEWS!The surprising group that dropped off is illegals Yes, some illegals ARE eligible for food stamps! The USDA has this SNAP FOR NON-CITIZEN GUIDANCEWith the states of Georgia and Alabama leading the way, more than 1.1 million Americans dropped off the food stamp rolls since President Trump took office in January 2017, according to the latest U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) statistics on food stamp enrollment. Participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) dropped to 41,496,255 in May 2017, the most recent data available from the USDA, from 42,691,363 in January 2017 when Trump took office.According to the latest data, SNAP enrollment during the first few months of Trump s presidency decreased by 2.79 percent.Food stamp participation on average in 2017 has dropped to its lowest level since 2010, and the latest numbers show that this trend is continuing.Trump proposed cuts to SNAP in his 2018 budget proposal, suggesting that states match up to 20 percent of federal money allotted for the food stamp program and expand work requirements for able-bodied adults receiving food stamps.Trump s crackdown on illegal immigration has also prompted many immigrants, both legal and illegal, to cancel their food stamps over concerns that they might be denied citizenship or deported.Federal lawmakers are also working on legislation that would seek to expand food stamp work requirements and put time limits on how long those enrolled in the food stamp program can receive benefits.Read more: Breitbart News",Government News,"Aug 8, 2017",Fake
FACTORY WORKER RIPS INTO Speaker Paul Ryan on the â€œDo Nothingâ€ Congress [Video],"We love this guy!

We don t have the presidency and when we get in we got a plan and we re going to change stuff.  Well I tell you what, you re in there now and all I see is infighting. It s very dysfunctional.This guy just said whatever American would like to say to Paul Ryan! Notice how the answer was just more rhetoric blah, blah, blah All talk and NO ACTION!Paul Ryan is in the back pocket of the Chamber of Commerce and other special interest groups. He s talking out of both sides of his mouth. He needs to go!PAUL RYAN AUDIO GIVES US INSIGHT INTO HOW HE REALLY FEELS ABOUT TRUMP:AUDIO RELEASED: Paul Ryan Caught On Tape:  I am not going to defend Donald Trump not now, not in the future We all know Paul Ryan was no fan of President Donald Trump while he was running for office. Sadly, unlike the Democrats who held their noses and went  all in  for Hillary, our Republican Speaker of the House went out of his way to NOT support Trump during his highly contentious campaign. Now that a new audio tape has emerged, proving that Ryan went out of his way to make sure his colleagues in the House understood that he would  never  support Trump, this leaves Ryan looking pretty foolish considering the public support Trump has offered Ryan and his increasingly unpopular  Obamacare Lite  proposal.On a never-before-released private October conference call with House Republican members, House Speaker Paul Ryan told his members in the U.S. House of Representatives he was abandoning then-GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump forever and would never defend him ever again. In the Oct. 10, 2016 call, from right after the Access Hollywood tape of Trump was leaked in the weeks leading up to the election, Ryan does not specify that he will never defend Trump on just the Access Hollywood tape he says clearly he is done with Trump altogether. I am not going to defend Donald Trump not now, not in the future,  Ryan says in the audio, obtained by Breitbart News and published here for the first time ever.Now, Ryan still the Speaker has pushed now President Donald Trump to believe his healthcare legislation the American Health Care Act would repeal and replace Obamacare when it does not repeal Obamacare. Ryan has also, according to Trump ally Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), misled President Trump into believing that Ryan s bill can pass Congress. Paul and others believe the bill is dead on arrival in the U.S. Senate since a number of GOP senators have come out against it, and there are serious questions about whether it can pass the House. This is the first major initiative that Trump has worked on with Ryan and the fact it is going so poorly calls into question whether Speaker Ryan, the GOP s failed 2012 vice presidential nominee who barely supported Trump at all in 2016, really understands how Trump won and how to win in general.The October conference call apparently was intended only for House Republican members. It s unclear which or how many House Republicans took part in the call, whether the participants knew it was being recorded, who made the recording, or whether a recording exists of the entire call. The remarks on the portion provided to Breitbart News certainly sound like they were coming from Speaker Ryan, who seemed to be abandoning his party s presidential nominee altogether just weeks before the election. He says not only will he not defend the Access Hollywood comments, but he will not campaign with Trump at all between this call on Oct. 10, 2016, and the general election for the presidency on Nov. 8 and that Ryan would not defend Trump on anything generally.

HUD SECRETARY BEN CARSON Ending Obamaâ€™s Illegal Section 8 Housing Grant Scheme,"After his reelection in 2012 Obama removed the bidding process from section 8 housing. Obama then schemed to provide HUD initiated grants to their  pet  organizations. After lawsuits and ultimately with the Supreme Court rebuking the grant-style process, HUD Secretary Ben Carson is bringing back a more efficient bidding process that also saves taxpayer dollars. Great job Dr. Carson!The Department of Housing and Urban Development is poised to reverse the Obama administration s policy and return to a competitive bidding process to award Section 8 housing, according to a well-placed source in the department.The move would overturn the Obama-era methodology of using a grant-style process that was rebuked by administrators and ultimately the U.S. Supreme Court.The HUD official said many of the steps necessary to change back to the competitive procurement method are being taken now, but didn t want to comment on when the announcement from the department might happen for fear of tainting the bidding process.Supporters of the competitive bidding procurement process say the net result will increase efficiency in the program and save taxpayer money. And Republican lawmakers that have been critical of HUD s actions in the past are applauding the change in course as well. When dealing with performance-based Section 8 contract administrators, it s clear that full and open competition is the way to get the best value for the taxpayer,  said Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla.  As Chairman of the Housing Appropriations Subcommittee, I have repeatedly insisted both publicly and privately that HUD follow Congressional intent, the GAO, and the Supreme Court. Diaz-Balart is one of a small handful of elected officials who put pressure on HUD and then-Secretary Juli n Castro during the years in which HUD ignored findings that their grant process was illegal.Section 8 housing is a federal program that pays rental assistance to landlords to help low-income people acquire affordable housing.Because HUD had problems administering the program, in 1995 it started to contract out the management of Section 8 housing units through a competitive bidding process. However, in March of 2012, HUD suddenly shifted away from the competitive bidding process, and began using funding mechanisms which were more like grants.Contractors who had previously gained HUD s business under the bidding process appealed to the Government Accountability Office in 2012, just months after HUD changed course. And by August of that year, the GAO ruled that HUD s actions were  unreasonable and in disregard of applicable statutory guidance. Undeterred, HUD pressed forward with their choice, which then made them the target of a lawsuit. From that point, HUD lost an embarrassing string of rulings which culminated in the U.S. Supreme Court denying to hear an appeal from the agency in April of 2015.Despite all those rulings, HUD didn t budge. But the Trump administration is now set to return to the previous methods.Eric Strong is the CEO of Navigate Affordable Housing Partners, a company that has won HUD Section 8 contracts in the past under the competitive system. He s also publicly lobbied HUD to change back to the performance based contracting method. All we ve ever wanted was fair and open competition because we know it results in the best financial situation for the taxpayer and also will result in better housing for the residents who live in those Section 8 units, Read more: WE",Government News,"Aug 7, 2017",Fake
UN AMBASSADOR SAMANTHA POWER Unmasked Hundreds of Trump Associates During 2016 Election [Video],"Adam Kredo of WFB asks the question we all want the answer to:  The fact that this information subsequently leaked to the press, I think raises even more questions about why a U.N ambassador over in Turtle Bay needs to unmask.  Samantha Power is a longtime Obama loyalist but her husband might be the key to all of this (see below).Power is believed to have made  hundreds  of unmasking requests to  identify individuals named in classified intelligence community reports related to Trump and his presidential transition team, according to multiple sources who said the behavior is unprecedented for an official in her position,  according to the Washington Free Beacon.Hannity asked Kredo how Power would ever have the authority to make the unmasking requests, and then asked whether this has ever happened previously to his knowledge. No, it s truly unprecedented,  Kredo said.  It s certainly odd, and I think the House Intelligence Committee, rightfully so, has subpoenaed her to find out what is going on here. Look, it s hundreds of unmasking requests in just the final year of the Obama administration. WE VE FOLLOWED THE  QUEEN OF GEORGE SOROS  AND HERE S WHAT WE KNOW:In 2005 06, Power worked as a foreign policy fellow in the office of U.S. Senator Barack Obama.In a 2007 interview, Power said that America s relationship with Israel  has often led foreign policy decision-makers to defer reflexively to Israeli security assessments, and to replicate Israeli tactics  The United States, she explained, had brought terrorist attacks upon itself by aping Israel s violations of human rights.Power has had her fair share of controversy, specifically after she was forced to resign from the president s 2008 campaign following negative remarks she made about Hillary Clinton.In an interview with The Scotsman during the heat of the 2008 presidential race, Power called Clinton a  monster. Power was soon back in with the Obama camp. Her husband is Obama s former Regulatory Czar Cass Sunstein.SUNSTEIN IS ONE SCARY GUY WHO WANTED GOVERNMENT TO INTRUDE ON YOUR PRIVACY:SALON reported:Cass Sunstein has long been one of Barack Obama s closest confidants. Often mentioned as a likely Obama nominee to the Supreme Court, Sunstein is Obama s head of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs where, among other things, he is responsible for  overseeing policies relating to privacy, information quality, and statistical programs.  In 2008, while at Harvard Law School, Sunstein co-wrote a truly pernicious paper proposing that the U.S. Government employ teams of covert agents and pseudo- independent  advocates to  cognitively infiltrate  online groups and websites   as well as other activist groups   which advocate views that Sunstein deems  false conspiracy theories  about the Government. This would be designed to increase citizens  faith in government officials and undermine the credibility of conspiracists. The paper s abstract can be read, and the full paper downloaded, here.Sunstein advocates that the Government s stealth infiltration should be accomplished by sending covert agents into  chat rooms, online social networks, or even real-space groups.  He also proposes that the Government make secret payments to so-called  independent  credible voices to bolster the Government s messaging (on the ground that those who don t believe government sources will be more inclined to listen to those who appear independent while secretly acting on behalf of the Government). This program would target those advocating false  conspiracy theories,  which they define to mean:  an attempt to explain an event or practice by reference to the machinations of powerful people, who have also managed to conceal their role.

AUDIT: Obamaâ€™s IRS â€˜Misledâ€™ Americans to Get Them to Sign Up for Obamacare,"Soooo the IRS lied to Americans to  prod  them to comply and sign up for Obamacare. They lied about the cost of Obamacare. Does anyone see the criminality in this? It s a classic bait and switch but by our government! The Obama administration  misled  Americans into thinking signing up for Obamacare would be cheaper than it really was, according to an inspector general s report Thursday that said the IRS dramatically understated the actual cost of enrolling. IRS officials sent the letters to try to prod Americans to comply with the 2010 health law s  individual mandate  that penalizes them for not holding coverage.But as part of the letters, the IRS said most people could find plans for $75 a month or less once government subsidies were figured in. That was untrue   in fact, the average cost was more than twice that figure, at $168 a month, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration said. Many of the nearly 7.5 million taxpayers who receive letters and seek insurance may feel misled if the actual cost of their insurance is much higher than the $75 per month detailed in their notification letter,  the inspector general concluded. The IRS said it was only using numbers provided by Department of Health and Human Services and verified by the Treasury Department. They said the $75 figure was true for some taxpayers.The inspector general said it asked for that documentation but never received it.Auditors said their own analysis found the HHS studies were based on a smaller sample and was limited to those who chose lower-coverage plans with fewer benefits.According to the new audit, federal regulations require agencies to present accurate information.Investigators uncovered the misleading information as part of a broader audit about how the IRS was handling its role in alerting Americans who aren t complying with Obamacare s mandate to hold insurance.Read more: WT ",Government News,"Aug 4, 2017",Fake

Why Donald J. Trump Is The Only One Who Can Defeat An Anti-American Party Thatâ€™s Gone Unopposed For 50 YearsÂ ,"Every American should read and share this brilliant article.So, to my friends on the Left   and the #NeverTrumpers as well   do I wish we lived in a time when our president could be  collegial  and  dignified  and  proper ? Of course I do. These aren t those times. This is war. And it s a war that the Left has been fighting without opposition for the past 50 years.So, say anything you want about this president   I get it, he can be vulgar, he can be crude, he can be undignified at times. I don t care. I can t spare this man. He fightsHE FIGHTSMy Leftist friends (as well as many ardent #NeverTrumpers) constantly ask me if I m not bothered by Donald Trump s lack of decorum. They ask if I don t think his tweets are  beneath the dignity of the office.  Here s my answer:We Right-thinking people have tried dignity. There could not have been a man of more quiet dignity than George W. Bush as he suffered the outrageous lies and politically motivated hatreds that undermined his presidency. We tried statesmanship. Could there be another human being on this earth who so desperately prized  collegiality  as John McCain? We tried propriety   has there been a nicer human being ever than Mitt Romney? And the results were always the same.This is because, while we were playing by the rules of dignity, collegiality and propriety, the Left has been, for the past 60 years, engaged in a knife fight where the only rules are those of Saul Alinsky and the Chicago mob.I don t find anything  dignified,   collegial  or  proper  about Barack Obama s lying about what went down on the streets of Ferguson in order to ramp up racial hatreds because racial hatreds serve the Democratic Party. I don t see anything  dignified  in lying about the deaths of four Americans in Benghazi and imprisoning an innocent filmmaker to cover your tracks. I don t see anything  statesman-like  in weaponizing the IRS to be used to destroy your political opponents and any dissent. Yes, Obama was  articulate  and  polished  but in no way was he in the least bit  dignified,   collegial  or  proper. The Left has been engaged in a war against America since the rise of the Children of the  60s. To them, it has been an all-out war where nothing is held sacred and nothing is seen as beyond the pale. It has been a war they ve fought with violence, the threat of violence, demagoguery and lies from day one   the violent take-over of the universities   till today.The problem is, through these years, the Left has been the only side fighting this war. While the Left has been taking a knife to anyone who stands in their way, the Right has continued to act with dignity, collegiality and propriety.With Donald Trump, this all has come to an end. Donald Trump is America s first wartime president in the Culture War.During wartime, things like  dignity  and  collegiality  simply aren t the most essential qualities one looks for in their warriors. Ulysses Grant was a drunk whose behavior in peacetime might well have seen him drummed out of the Army for conduct unbecoming. Had Abraham Lincoln applied the peacetime rules of propriety and booted Grant, the Democrats might well still be holding their slaves today. Lincoln rightly recognized that,  I cannot spare this man. He fights. General George Patton was a vulgar-talking, son-of-a-bitch. In peacetime, this might have seen him stripped of rank. But, had Franklin Roosevelt applied the normal rules of decorum, then Hitler and the Socialists would barely be five decades into their thousand-year Reich.Trump is fighting. And what s particularly delicious is that, like Patton standing over the battlefield as his tanks obliterated Rommel s, he s shouting,  You magnificent bastards, I read your book!  That is just the icing on the cake, but it s wonderful to see that not only is Trump fighting, he s defeating the Left using their own tactics.That book is Saul Alinsky s Rules for Radicals   a book so essential to the Liberals  war against America that it is and was the playbook for the entire Obama administration and the subject of Hillary Clinton s senior thesis. It is a book of such pure evil, that, just as the rest of us would dedicate our book to those we most love or those to whom we are most indebted, Alinsky dedicated his book to Lucifer.Trump s tweets may seem rash and unconsidered but, in reality, he is doing exactly what Alinsky suggested his followers do. First, instead of going after  the fake media    and they are so fake that they have literally gotten every single significant story of the past 60 years not just wrong, but diametrically opposed to the truth, from the Tet Offensive to Benghazi, to what really happened on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri   Trump has isolated CNN. He made it personal. Then, just as Alinsky suggests, he employs ridicule which Alinsky described as  the most powerful weapon of all. Everyone gets that it s not just CNN   in fact, in a world where Al Sharpton and Rachel Maddow, Paul Krugman and Nicholas Kristof are people of influence and whose  reporting  is in no way significantly different than CNN s   CNN is just a piker.Most importantly, Trump s tweets have put CNN in an untenable and unwinnable position. With Trump s ability to go around them, they cannot simply stand pat. They need to respond. This leaves them with only two choices.They can either  go high  (as Hillary would disingenuously declare of herself and the fake news would disingenuously report as the truth) and begin to honestly and accurately report the news or they can double-down on their usual tactics and hope to defeat Trump with twice their usual hysteria and demagoguery.The problem for CNN (et al.) with the former is, if they were to start honestly reporting the news, that would be the end of the Democratic Party they serve. It is nothing but the incessant use of fake news (read: propaganda) that keeps the Left alive. Imagine, for example, if CNN had honestly and accurately reported then-candidate Barack Obama s close ties to foreign terrorists (Rashid Khalidi), domestic terrorists (William Ayers), the mafia (Tony Rezko) or the true evils of his spiritual mentor, Jeremiah Wright s, church.Imagine if they had honestly and accurately conveyed the evils of the Obama administration s weaponizing of the IRS to be used against their political opponents or his running of guns to the Mexican cartels or the truth about the murder of Ambassador Christopher Stevens and the Obama administration s cover-up. This makes  going high  a non-starter for CNN. This leaves them no other option but to ratchet up the fake news, conjuring up the next  nothing burger  and devoting 24 hours a day to hysterical rants about how it s  worse than Nixon. This, obviously, is what CNN has chosen to do. The problem is, as they become more and more hysterical, they become more and more obvious. Each new effort at even faker news than before, and faker  outrage  only makes that much more clear to any objective observer that Trump is and always has been right about the fake news media.And, by causing their hysteria, Trump has forced them into numerous, highly embarrassing and discrediting mistakes. Thus, in their desperation, they have lowered their standards even further and run with articles so clearly fake that, even with the liberal (lower case  l ) libel laws protecting the media, they ve had to wholly retract and erase their stories repeatedly.Their flailing at Trump has even seen them cross the line into criminality, with CNN using their vast corporate fortune to hunt down a private citizen for having made fun of them in an Internet meme. This threat to  dox    release of personal information to encourage co-ideologists to visit violence upon him and his family   a political satirist was chilling in that it clearly wasn t meant just for him. If it were, there would have been no reason for CNN to have made their  deal  with him public.Instead, CNN   playing by  Chicago Rules    was sending a message to any and all: dissent will not be tolerated. This heavy-handed and hysterical response to a joke on the Internet has backfired on CNN, giving rise to only more righteous ridicule.So, to my friends on the Left   and the #NeverTrumpers as well   do I wish we lived in a time when our president could be  collegial  and  dignified  and  proper ? Of course I do. These aren t those times. This is war. And it s a war that the Left has been fighting without opposition for the past 50 years.So, say anything you want about this president   I get it, he can be vulgar, he can be crude, he can be undignified at times.

McMaster, sent an official letter giving her unfettered and continuing access to classified information and waiving her  need-to-know  requirement on anything she viewed or received during her tenure, Circa has confirmed.The undated and unclassified letter from McMaster was sent in the mail to Rice s home during the last week of April. Trump was not aware of the letter or McMaster s decision, according to two Senior West Wing officials and an intelligence official, who spoke to Circa on condition that they not be named. This is the letter from McMaster to Rice. Names, phone numbers and personal addresses have been blurred. I hereby waive the requirement that you must have a  need-to-know  to access any classified information contained in items you  originated, reviewed, signed or received while serving,  as National Security Adviser,  the letter said. The letter also states that the  NSC will continue to work with you to ensure the appropriate security clearance documentation remains on file to allow you access to classified information. Circa revealed in March that during President Obama s tenure, top aides   including Rice, former CIA Director John Brennan and former Attorney General Loretta Lynch   routinely reviewed intelligence reports received from the National Security Agency s incidental intercepts of Americans abroad. They were doing so by taking advantage of rules Obama relaxed starting in 2011 to help the government better fight terrorism, espionage by foreign enemies and hacking threats, according to documents obtained by Circa.In June, the House Intelligence Committee subpoenaed Rice as part of the committee s larger investigation into the unmasking of Americans under the Obama administration. Rice maintains that she never accessed the information inappropriately and has agreed to testify before the committee.Under the law, and under certain conditions, it is common practice for some senior government officials to be given the unfettered access to classified information, and their  need to know  is waived under  Executive Order 13526 Section 4.4 Access by Historical Researchers and Certain Former Government Personnel.  But the White House officials told Circa that under the current congressional investigation, and given President Trump s ongoing concern that members of his team were unmasked, Rice s clearance should have been limited to congressional testimony only or revoked until the end of the investigation. Rice and Brennan have confirmed they sought the unredacted names of Americans in NSA-sourced intelligence reports, but insisted their requests were routine parts of their work and that they did nothing improper. Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power also has legal authority to unmask officials.In a June tweet, Trump called the revelation that Rice and other Obama senior officials were unmasking members of his team the  big story  the  unmasking and surveillance  that took place during the Obama administration. Basically, this letter which was signed in the last week of April undercuts the president s assertion that Susan Rice s unmasking activity was inappropriate. In essence, anybody who committed a violation as she did would not be given access to classified information,  said a senior West Wing official, who was shown the document by Circa and verified its authenticity.  In fact, they would have their security clearance and right to  need-to-know  stripped. The point is, is that it lowers the bar for her,  the Senior West Wing official said. This memo McMaster sent to Rice makes it so that she doesn t have to prove a continuing  need-to-know  to have access to classified information and in effect is a White House pardon of Susan Rice and could be used by other Obama officials who conducted targeted unmasking of the campaign as a defense,  the official added.REMEMBER THAT RICE RECENTLY LIED AGAIN ABOUT THE UNMASKING   SHE DID IT ON NATIONAL TV:If the Obama administration was good at anything, it was good at lying to hijack the narrative.Remember when Susan Rice lied after Benghazi? It is what she does so well. Flash forward to the latest hot water she s in and it s hard to tell what she d want us believe this time WHICH SHOULD WE BELIEVE? WHAT SHE SAID TO ANDREA MITCHELL OR TO JUDY WOODRUFF?Susan Rice appeared on Andrea Mitchell. She claimed she didn t leak  nothing to nobody Did you catch that double negative?There might be more to that because she s using words in the two sentences very carefully .Check it out:SUSAN RICE VERSION ONE:WATCH: Susan Rice insists  I leaked nothing to nobody  https://t.co/kAsbu4VJDN  MSNBC (@MSNBC) April 4, 2017SUSAN RICE VERSION TWO: I know nothing about this. I was surprised to see reports from Chairman Nunes on that count today. What she says is a lie but who is surprised by this? We know that Susan Rice lied 5 times on 5 different morning shows the morning after Benghazi. Why wouldn t she try and cover this spying up to protect herself and others including Obama.Susan Rice is also giving conflicting stories on what she did so it might be a good idea for her to lawyer up right now. She claimed ignorance of the unmasking and spying but today she spoke about doing it. Yes, red flags are everywhere on this! The reality and truth is this was more of a political attack to destabilize the Trump presidency and embarrass him:The bottom line is that laws were broken when the names were unmasked Someone s in BIG trouble!Read more: circa news",Government News,"Aug 3, 2017",Fake
WHY TRUMPâ€™S DOJ Gets Asian Support in Fight Against â€˜Race-Based College Admissions Policiesâ€™,"Have you ever heard of the  bamboo ceiling ? The term was used when referring to the Harvard quotas against Asian students. Did you know that Asian students are harmed by racial quotas in college admissions like no other group? Affirmative action was supposed to help promote equality in college admissions but is having the opposite effect by discriminating against Asian students in a BIG way! It s why one large Asian group has come out in favor of Trump s DOJ in their effort to stop discrimination against Asian students and others in the current  race-based college admissions policies .One Asian-American legal group is pleased with the announcement that the Department of Justice might examine affirmative action, saying it represents a positive development in the fight against race-based college admission policies.Studies on affirmative action have shown that Asian-American students might suffer more from these race-based policies than other ethnic groups. A 2009 studied revealed Asian American students often have to score higher on their SATs than their white, black and Latin counterparts to be considered on the same playing field.Lee Cheng, the co-founder and director of the Asian American Legal Foundation, spoke to The Daily Caller News Foundation about his hope that the DOJ will now be a partner in the fight against race-based policies in college admissions. Now there is a voice in DC that we can appeal to. There s an administration and there are people at the federal government level who want to enforce civil rights as they were meant to be enforced, which is to protect individual rights of all Americans regardless of race. So we view that as certainly a very positive development,  Cheng told TheDCNF.  We absolutely intend to keep an eye on the development of schools across the country and where we find discrimination under the euphemism of affirmative action we would definitely let the DOJ know that they should investigate. The New York Times broke news Tuesday night of an internal DOJ memo asking lawyers in the civil rights division whether they are willing to perform  investigations and possible litigation related to intentional race-based discrimination in college and university admissions.  The memo does not make absolutely clear what groups are affected by these affirmative action policies.Read more: Daily Caller",Government News,"Aug 3, 2017",Fake
JILL STEIN CONCEDES Recount In Michigan In Bizarre Press Conference [VIDEO],"Officially, history will record President-elect Donald Trump as having won the 2016 presidential race in Michigan by some 10,704 votes.But Dr. Jill Stein, the Green Party s presidential candidate in the 2016 election, believes that the numbers would be different if all 4.8 million votes cast in the Wolverine State were recounted.That won t happen, Stein conceded in a rally in downtown Detroit on Saturday, a day after the non-recused members of the Michigan Supreme Court ruled, by a 3-2 margin, against Stein s appeal, leaving the candidate with no recourse. We may be moving out of the court of law, but we re moving into the court of public opinion,  Stein said.The rally lasted about 40 minutes in freezing temperatures, and attracted dozens of the candidate s supporters. It took place near the foot of a street named ceremonially for Congressman John Conyers, Washington Boulevard. Bell, a Green Party member who helped supervise the vote-counting effort at Cobo, became emotional several times during her brief remarks, during which she called the election system in Michigan  a flaming hot mess,  a language Stein would herself adopt. Even if the results of the 2016 election won t change, and even if there won t be a full recount in Michigan, Stein said, the state needs election reform.Bell called out voting irregularities she d learned of, like how a polling place in Ionia County allegedly used a garbage can as a ballot box, or one in Gibraltar that sealed a ballot box with mere duct tape, or a precinct in Detroit that tabulated 300 votes but only 50 were found in the box. Hot mess! Hot mess!  Bell said before handing the microphone to Stein. Count every vote, and make sure every vote counts,  Stein said.  This dysfunction in our elections flows downhill. It flows to communities that do not have resources The equipment that s used is prone to break. And it s not just the 87 scanners that failed in Detroit on Election Day. What raised a  red flag  in Michigan, Stein said, was the 75,000 ballots cast without also making a choice in the presidential race. MLive",left-news,"Dec 11, 2016",Fake
REINCE PRIEBUS Embarrasses Snarky NBC Meet The Press Host For Promoting FAKE Russian RNC Hacking Story [VIDEO],"The entire premise for Chuck Todd s position is two media reports.  One of those media reports (NYT) is demonstrably false; the second (WaPo) is specifically constructed to target and undermine the Trump presidency.

"KELLYANNE CONWAY Responds To DEATH THREATS Against Her After Hillaryâ€™s Communications Director Pens Hate-Filled, Inflammatory Washington Post Op-Ed [VIDEO]","Donald Trump s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway and Hillary Clinton campaign communications director Jennifer Palmieri got in a very heated argument at a forum hosted by Harvard University s Kennedy School of Government on December 1st where they talked about the aftermath of the election. There were many fiery exchanges.The conversation quickly devolved into Palmieri accusing the Trump campaign of running on a platform of white supremacy and catering to the  alt-right.  Conway called the Clinton campaign bitter and that their candidate just couldn t connect with people is the reason why they lost.Here is the exchange:.@KellyannePolls talks to @HardballChris about receiving death threats and the need to end incendiary rhetoric https://t.co/wF6jv1b8nl  Hardball (@hardball) December 9, 2016Here is the Op-ed written by sore loser and closet Catholic-basher Jen Palmieri who clearly can t get over the fact that a woman helped Trump win the presidency. It s also the op-ed that according to Conway caused her to receive death threats:Jennifer Palmieri was communications director for Hillary Clinton s presidential campaign.I know how to be a gracious loser.I could have let it go last week when Kellyanne Conway, Donald Trump s campaign manager, challenged me to look her in the eye and say she ran a campaign that gave white supremacists a platform. I considered for a split second. I knew you were supposed to be gracious when you come for the post-election forum at Harvard s Kennedy School of Government. But I decided this was a year where normal rules don t apply. Speaking the truth was more important. It did. Kellyanne, it did,  I told her. It s just a fact. Trump winning the election doesn t change that. To my mind, his win makes it all the more important that the truth be acknowledged.My colleagues and I from the Hillary Clinton campaign knew what we were likely to face from the Trump side at the Harvard University event and thought hard about our obligations as representatives of the losing side in this most unconventional of years   particularly when our candidate actually won the popular vote by a large margin. As I like to note, Clinton received more votes for president than any white man in U.S. history.Our candidate gave us a good model to follow. She had the grace to call Trump on election night to congratulate him and concede. But in her concession speech she also challenged all of us to defend our rights and principles under the Constitution   rights and principles that she and many of the people who voted for her feared could be under threat in a Trump presidency. The campaign has ended, and we accept that Trump won. But we are not laying down our principles or abandoning our supporters. That s the frame of mind I brought to Harvard.A good bit of the post-election analysis has centered on what our campaign should have done differently. That s appropriate. We should think long and hard about why we lost. Trust me, we have.But it s also important for the winners of this campaign to think long and hard about the voters who rejected them. I haven t seen much evidence of such introspection from the Trump side. That s concerning.I don t know whether the Trump campaign needed to give a platform to white supremacists to win. But the campaign clearly did, and it had the effect of empowering the white-nationalist movement.Trump provided a platform by retweeting white nationalists   giving their views an audience of millions. Views previously relegated to the darkest corners of the Internet also had a platform on Breitbart, the website of Trump campaign chief executive Stephen K. Bannon.  Before Trump, our identity ideas, national ideas, they had no place to go,  said Richard Spencer, president of a white-nationalist think tank that held a post-election conference in Washington. Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke said this fall,  The fact that Donald Trump s doing so well, it proves that I m winning. So one person who is tied to a white nationalist think tank says he supports Trump on Twitter and that somehow confirms that Trump s campaign was built around a white nationalist movement?If you want to waste more time reading this sore loser s false and unfounded accusations, the entire op-ed can be found here: Washington Post",left-news,"Dec 11, 2016",Fake

"WAR HAWK, ANTI-TRUMPER RINOS Join Dems To Investigate Russian Influence In Electionâ€¦Trump Says Russian Interference Claim Is â€œRidiculousâ€[VIDEO]","Pro man-made climate change, RINO Lindsay Graham, who never saw a war he didn t want to engage our troops in, joins his war hawk, RINO, anti-Trumper friend John McCain (who got crushed by Obama in the 2008 Presidential election), to call for investigations into Russian influence in our November elections. John McCain withdrew his support for Trump after the bad words he used in a private conversation with another guy. Lindsey Graham got crushed by Trump in the primaries and was a loud voice against his nomination. He eventually changed his mind and offered his support for Trump in the general election against Hillary. John McCain did not change his mind.The recount is over, but there s still time to discredit the legitimacy of Donald J. Trump s landslide election. Who better to help the Democrats, than two RINO s who are at the top of the heap when it comes to draining useless Republicans from  the swamp. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham (R) said Wednesday he would lead a charge to investigate Russia s interference in the U.S. election and hacks on the Democratic Party. I think [Donald] Trump should take a real tough tone with Russia, because if he doesn t, you re going to allow Russia to begin to break apart alliances,  Graham told CNN s Manu Raju.The Republican senator also said he hoped to use his leadership role on two subcommittees to launch a deeper investigation of Russia s hacks, CNN reported. Graham chairs the State, Foreign Operations and Related Programs subcommittee and the Crime and Terrorism subcommittee.Raju said Graham told him that he and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), chair of the Armed Services Committee, will travel to Eastern Europe to investigate Russian meddling in other countries  elections.During the campaign, Graham was a strong GOP critic of Trump, including on his friendlier stance toward Russia, and chose to vote instead for independent candidate Evan McMullin.  The HillThe Obama administration clearly stated that they saw NO evidence of outside election tampering in the general election.On November 26, 2016 the Obama administration said it has seen no evidence of hackers tampering with the 2016 presidential election, even as recount proceedings began in Wisconsin. We stand behind our election results, which accurately reflect the will of the American people,  a senior administration official told POLITICO late Friday. The federal government did not observe any increased level of malicious cyber activity aimed at disrupting our electoral process on election day,  the official added.  We believe our elections were free and fair from a cybersecurity perspective. Yet yesterday this story appeared in the New York Times: WASHINGTON   American intelligence agencies have concluded with  high confidence  that Russia acted covertly in the latter stages of the presidential campaign to harm Hillary Clinton s chances and promote Donald J. Trump, according to senior administration officials.They based that conclusion, in part, on another finding   which they say was also reached with high confidence   that the Russians hacked the Republican National Committee s computer systems in addition to their attacks on Democratic organizations, but did not release whatever information they gleaned from the Republican networks.In the months before the election, it was largely documents from Democratic Party systems that were leaked to the public. Intelligence agencies have concluded that the Russians gave the Democrats  documents to WikiLeaks.Republicans have a different explanation for why no documents from their networks were ever released. Over the past several months, officials from the Republican committee have consistently said that their networks were not compromised, asserting that only the accounts of individual Republicans were attacked. On Friday, a senior committee official said he had no comment.Donald Trump has said the CIA s conclusion that Russia interfered in the presidential election is  ridiculous  and being used by Democrats as  just another excuse  for his defeat of Hillary Clinton.The president-elect told Fox News Sunday that he did not necessarily oppose Barack Obama s order for a review of campaign-season cyber-attacks.But he added that in any such effort,  you should not just say  Russia . You should say other countries also, and maybe other individuals.   Guardian",left-news,"Dec 11, 2016",Fake
KELLYANNE CONWAY Delivers KNOCK OUT Punch To Smug Jake Tapper At CNN Town Hall Forum [VIDEO],"When an audience member asks Kellyanne Conway if Trump will continue to use Twitter as a means to communicate with Americans, he ended his comment with a swipe at Trump not being entirely truthful with his tweets. Kellyanne Conway responded that it would be up to him and the Secret Service, and that he looks at it as a very good platform for him to convey his messages.Jake Tapper suggested that Trump s tweet about 3 million illegal aliens voting in the election was false. Of course Tapper has no evidence to back up his assertion. The state of California alone has over 2.6 million illegal aliens who could ve technically voted in the election. In fact, the two top counties where Hillary received the most votes, are coincidentally the same two counties who have the highest percentage of illegal aliens. In October, 2015, a California state bill was signed in to law by Gov. Jerry Brown, that registers and allows illegal aliens to vote in US Elections. So just in the state of California alone, over 2.6 million illegal aliens could have voted in the election. We haven t even talked about the illegal aliens who weren t caught voting in this election because of loopholes in states that allowed illegal aliens to register to vote when they obtained legal drivers licenses.But Tapper pressed on asking:Tapper:  Is that really Presidential behavior? Conway:  Well he s the President-Elect, so that s Presidential behavior, yes. Tapper: So the things that Bill Clinton did in the Oval Office, that you criticized, those weren t Presidential? Conway:  Should we review for those who weren t born yet what President Clinton did in the Oval Office? Boom!https://youtu.be/t7tc3Gr0d5M",left-news,"Dec 10, 2016",Fake

OOPS! OBAMA Tells Troops No Foreign Terror Attacks Happened On His Watch: Hereâ€™s Complete List Of RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR Attacks On US Soil During His Presidency [VIDEO]," In a speech at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida on Tuesday, President Obama declared that  [n]o foreign terrorist organization has successfully planned and executed an attack on our homeland.  The claim earned perfunctory applause, but a closer look at the reaction of many of the servicemen and women there made clear what they really thought about the administration s handling of national security.Obama speaks to our troops at MacDill Air Force Base about foreign terror attacks on our homeland:The President s claim  which he has repeated in some form or fashion over the last few years  is an obvious rhetorical attempt to gloss over the reality of the threat of radical Islamic terror on American soil. The attempt to disconnect lone wolf  terrorists from the terror organizations who often inspire them does nothing to alleviate the pain of those who have suffered at the hands of jihadists and only hurts prevention efforts. Rhetorical tricks aside, the reality is that during Obama s tenure scores of innocent Americans have been murdered on U.S. soil by jihadists, most of whom were inspired by or acting under the direction of foreign terror groups, particularly the Islamic state.Below is a list of the major, verifiable radical Islamic terror attacks  successfully planned and executed  on U.S. soil since Obama first took office in 2009 (the first section provided by Daily Wire s Aaron Bandler): Little Rock, Arkansas, June 1, 2009. Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad shot and murdered one soldier, Army Pvt. William Andrew Long, and injured another, Pvt. Quinton Ezeagwula, at a military recruiting station in Little Rock. Muhammad reportedly converted to Islam in college and was on the FBI s radar after being arrested in Yemen a hotbed of radical Islamic terrorism for using a Somali passport, even though he was a U.S. citizen. In a note to an Arkansas judge, Muhammad claimed to be a member of al-Qaeda in the Arab Peninsula, the terror group s Yemen chapter.Fort Hood, Texas, November 5, 2009. Major Nidal Malik Hasan shot up a military base in Fort Hood and murdered 14 people. Hasan was in contact with al-Qaeda terrorist Anwar al-Awlaki prior to the attack and shouted Allahu Akbar! as he fired upon the soldiers on the Fort Hood base. After being sentenced to death, Hasan requested to join ISIS while on death row. It took six years for Obama to acknowledge the shooting as a terror attack instead of  workplace violence. Boston, Massachusetts, April 15, 2013. Tamerlan and Dhozkar Tsarnaev set off two bombs at the 2013 Boston marathon, killing three and injuring over 260 people. The Tsarnaev brothers later shot and murdered Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer Sean Collier. The Tsarnaev brothers were self-radicalized through online jihadist propaganda and through a mosque with ties to al-Qaeda.Moore, Oklahoma, September 24, 2014. Alton Nolen beheaded a woman, Colleen Huff, at a Vaughan Foods plant and stabbed and injured another person. While Nolen s motives are unclear, he appears to have been another radicalized Muslim who was obsessed with beheadings.Queens, New York, October 23, 2014. Zale Thompson, another self-radicalized Muslim, injured two police officers with a hatchet before being shot dead by other cops. Thompson reportedly indoctrinated himself with ISIS, al-Qaeda and al-Shabab a Somali jihadist terror group websites and was a lone wolf attacker.Brooklyn, New York, December 20, 2014.

Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez shot and killed four Marines and a sailor at a military base in Chattanooga and was believed to have been inspired by ISIS.San Bernardino, California, December 14, 2015. Two radical Islamists, Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik, shot and murdered 14 people and injured 22 others at an office holiday party.Orlando, Florida, June 12, 2016. Omar Mateen, 29, opened fire at a gay nightclub, killing 49 and injuring 53. The FBI investigated Mateen twice before his rampage, but did not take any substantive action. Officials believe Mateen was self-radicalized but he pledged fealty to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi before his death.  The real muslims will never accept the filthy ways of the west, Mateen posted on his Facebook page after committing his heinous act at Pulse nightclub.  I pledge my alliance to (ISIS leader) abu bakr al Baghdadi..may Allah accept me, he wrote.St. Cloud, Minnesota, September 17, 2016. Dahir Ahmed Adan, a 20-year-old Somali refugee, began hacking at people with a steak knife at a Minnesota mall, injuring nine people before he was shot dead by off-duty police officer Jason Falconer. The FBI said numerous witnesses heard Adan yelling  Allahu akbar!  and  Islam! Islam!  during the rampage. He also asked potential victims if they were Muslims before inflicting wounds in their heads, necks, and chests. The FBI believe he had recently become self-radicalized. (As the Daily Wire highlighted, the Minneapolis Star Tribune attempted to blame  anti-Muslim tensions  for his murderous actions.)New York City/New Jersey, September 17, 2016. Ahmad Khan Rahami, a 28-year-old naturalized citizen from Afghanistan, set off multiple bombs in New York and New Jersey. In Chelsea, his bomb resulted in the injury of over 30 people. Rahami wrote in his journal that he was connected to  terrorist leaders,  and appears to have been heavily influenced by Sheikh Anwar, Anwar al-Awlaki, Nidal Hassan, and Osama bin Laden.  I pray to the beautiful wise ALLAH, [d]o not take JIHAD away from me,  Rahami wrote.

After his car was stopped by a barrier, he got out of the vehicle and began hacking at people with a butcher knife before being shot dead by a campus police officer. He injured 11 people, one critically. ISIS took credit for the attack, describing Artan as their  soldier.  Just three minutes before his rampage, Artan posted a warning to America on Facebook that the lone wolf attacks will continue until America  give[s] peace to the Muslims.

"BLACK LAWYER, Editor Of Legal Website Writes: Black Jurors Should Automatically Vote To Free Any Black Person Accused Of Murdering, Committing Crime Against A White Person Regardless Of Evidence","Elie Mystal, an editor and contributor to the law blog Above The Law, posted a December 7 article urging all black Americans who end up on juries to engage in  jury nullification  by automatically voting to acquit all blacks accused of crimes, especially that of murder, against white victims and to do so no matter how much evidence is brought to bear against the suspect.Mystal justified this lawlessness by claiming that  African-Americans live in a world where the police can murder us and get away with it. There is no justice for black people. And yet violently revolting against the system will get us nowhere,  he added.This, Mystal says, is reason enough to work against the legal system in all areas. Maybe it s time minorities got in the game?  Mystal added.Mystal goes on to call whites who have had a crime committed against them or who have been murdered a  purported  victim  and says blacks have no responsibility to help any white person  achieve justice.

NOT KIDDING! Serial Liar Brian Williams Blames â€œFAKE NEWSâ€ For Hillaryâ€™s Loss On MSNBC Last Night [VIDEO],"The man suspended from his TV anchor job for faking his own news is furious about the spread of  fake news. Brian Williams, who was forced to take a 6-month vacation before being permanently relieved of his  Nightly News  duties on NBC, railed about the new epidemic of  fake news  in his MSNBC show earlier this week. Fake news played a role in this election and continues to find a wide audience,  Williams whined Tuesday night in his middle-of-the-night show.Specifically, Williams singled out Trump s incoming national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, and his son for spreading falsehoods. Williams is no stranger to fake news. He was punished in February 2015 for lying about a helicopter ride in Iraq that he claimed came under heavy enemy fire.In 2003, Williams and an NBC team were reporting in Iraq when three Chinook helicopters came under fire.Williams claimed he was on one of the copters that were hit, when he aboard a different helicopter located about an hour behind the other three. I don t know what screwed up in my mind that caused me to conflate one aircraft with another,  Williams told  Stars and Stripes  after crew members from the helicopters that were hit that day came forward.Questions were also raised about Williams  coverage in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005.Williams claimed he could see bodies in flooding from his hotel room in the French Quarter.But the New Orleans Advocate reported that the French Quarter was largely spared in the catastrophe and saw little flooding.-NYP",left-news,"Dec 9, 2016",Fake
WOW! GEORGIA Refused Election Cyber-Support From Obamaâ€™s DHSâ€¦Now Sec Of State Demands Answers After Claiming DHS Tried To Breach His Officeâ€™s Firewall,"This is pretty scary stuff. A federal government agency run by an Obama crony attempting to penetrate the firewall of a State agency tasked with overseeing the elections? What conceivable reason could Obama s DHS have for hacking the Georgia Sec of State s office after the election?Georgia s secretary of state has claimed the Department of Homeland Security tried to breach his office s firewall and has issued a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson asking for an explanation.Brian Kemp issued a letter to Johnson on Thursday after the state s third-party cybersecurity provider detected an IP address from the agency s Southwest D.C. office trying to penetrate the state s firewall. According to the letter, the attempt was unsuccessful.The attempt took place on Nov. 15, a few days after the presidential election. The office of the Georgia Secretary of State is responsible for overseeing the state s elections. At no time has my office agreed to or permitted DHS to conduct penetration testing or security scans of our network,  Kemp wrote in the letter, which was also sent to the state s federal representatives and senators.  Moreover, your department has not contacted my office since this unsuccessful incident to alert us of any security event that would require testing or scanning of our network. This is especially odd and concerning since I serve on the Election Cyber Security Working Group that your office created. The Department of Homeland Security has received Secretary Kemp s letter,  a DHS spokesperson told CyberScoop.  We are looking into the matter. DHS takes the trust of our public and private sector partners seriously, and we will respond to Secretary Kemp directly. Georgia was one of two states that refused cyber-hygiene support and penetration testing from DHS in the lead up to the presidential election. The department had made a significant push for it after hackers spent months exposing the Democratic National Committee s internal communications and data.David Dove, Kemp s chief of staff, told CyberScoop the Georgia secretary of state s office  got a lot of grief  for refusing help from DHS. We basically said we don t need DHS s help,  because of the contract with the third-party provider, Dove said.The office of the Georgia Secretary of State would not reveal who the provider is, only saying the company  analyzes more than 180 billion events a day globally across a 5,000+ customer base which includes many Fortune 500 companies. Johnson announced shortly after the election that DHS found no evidence of an attack on Election Day.In the months and weeks leading up to the election fake news sources like The Washington Post did everything in their power to convince Americans that Georgia was in play for Hillary: The attempt took place on Nov. 15, a few days after the presidential election.

Leftist news sources like The Washington Post tried to convince voters that Hillary had a shot at winning the solidly red state of Georgia: A new Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll of the presidential race in that state puts Hillary Clinton in a slight lead over Donald Trump, 44 to 40. This is inside-the-margin-of-error stuff, mind you, but only barely. (It s also a break from the state of the race in the RealClearPolitics polling average, which gives Trump a four-point lead, though with only a handful of polls included.)Georgia has been shifting a bit politically in recent presidential elections, becoming slightly less Republican relative to the rest of the country   but it still has been voting more Republican than America on the whole. So in 2012, when Barack Obama won by four points, Mitt Romney won Georgia by eight   making the state 12 points more Republican, just a tick less than it was in 2008.With so many forces, and resources being used against Donald J. Trump, it s absolutely amazing he won the election ",left-news,"Dec 9, 2016",Fake

Penny s precinct, Detroit Precinct #152 had an unbroken seal and everything looked proper. The tag on the box said 306 and the book said 306 and the ticket said 306, so there should be 306 paper ballots on the box, right.

OBAMA TELLS TROOPS To Rise Up Against Trumpâ€¦Protest His Authorityâ€¦Feel Free To Criticize Him [VIDEO],"43 days and counting Characterizing the military s mission as a fight against  violent extremism,  Obama insisted that soldiers need to rise up against Trump if they feel he is pushing policies that are ill considered.Obama told the troops,  each of us has the universal right to speak your minds and to protest against authority; to live in a society that s open and free; that can criticize our president without retribution. Obama went on to insist that a proper U.S. policy against  violent extremism  is a  long term  policy. So rather than offer false promises that we can eliminate terrorism by dropping more bombs or deploying more and more troops or fencing ourselves off from the rest of the world,  Obama said,  we have to take a long view of the terrorist threat. And we have to pursue a smart strategy that can be sustained. In the time remaining, let me just suggest what I think should guide this approach. In addressing the war-torn Middle East, Obama insisted that global warming forms a large part of that conflict.  A changing climate is increasing competition for food and water,  which, he claimed, drives the conflict in Syria and other nearby nations.Obama also blamed the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution for  violent extremism  in the United States. Somebody who is trying to kill and willing to be killed is dangerous, particularly when we live in a country where it s very easy for that person to buy a very powerful weapon,  Obama insisted. The president also defended Islam against the charge of extremism:We are fighting terrorists who claim to fight on behalf of Islam. But they do not speak for over a billion Muslims around the world, and they do not speak for American Muslims including many who wear the uniform of the United States of America s military. If we stigmatize good patriotic Muslims, that just feeds the terrorists  narrative. It fuels the same false grievances they they use to motivate people to kill. If we act like this is a war between the United States and Islam, we re not gonna lose more Americans to terrorist attacks, but we ll also lose the sight of the very principles we claim to defend.As to the rise of ISIS, Obama insisted it was not given aide by his actions of pulling out of Iraq in 2011 but was instead given succor by the policies of George W. Bush. By 2011, Iraqis wanted our military presence to end, and they were unwilling to sign a new status of forces agreement to protect our troops from prosecution if they were trying to defend themselves in Iraq,  Obama proclaimed.  In addition, maintaining American troops in Iraq at the time could not have reversed the forces that contributed to ISIL s rise.   Breitbart ",left-news,"Dec 8, 2016",Fake

HOW BUZZFEED Is Using Social Media â€œNewsâ€ Feeds To Teach White Kids To Hate Themselves,"Does your child spend time on social media? Unless they re Amish, you should probably assume they do. My teenage daughter just shared with me one of the most racist, self-loathing articles with me that I have ever seen in print. This is the most hateful, racist articles aimed at shaming young, white Americans that you ve have ever seen. As we took a closer look at students featured in this  Buzzfeed  article, we were stunned by some of the racist postings we found on their social media accounts.I suppose it s okay for Buzzfeed to publish an article with the sole purpose of bashing its young white users, because thanks to Barack and Michelle Obama (the ultimate victims), who have been sowing the seeds of racism, division and hate from the White House, it s perfectly acceptable to trash white Americans. Never mind that Barack Obama is the President of the United States. What black United States President who was elected twice by a majority white nation would still consider himself and his wife victims of racism?  Here are some of the examples we found from the Buzzfeed article titled:  19 School Powerpoint Presentations That Give Zero F*cks  This article, and hundreds more just like it, show up in your children s Snapchat social media feeds, a place where teenagers and young adults frequently go to interact with each other, and where they are constantly bombarded with leftist indoctrination garbage like this: Controversial Tay  appears to be very proud of herself and how she s stirring it up at school, she actually goes as far as to say,  One day I feel like my professors just gon stop letting me do presentations.

She quickly turns it into a race issue, using his statement about the controlling the borders to suggest he,  doesn t want too many Latinos in our country.  She tells him  because you are white and you are so closed-minded  that he  doesn t accept the truth.  The teacher calls her out on her previous statement that,  white people are in control of everything,  by asking her what color our current President is? Watch how she quickly blames Congress for being white, which apparently makes a black man who holds the highest office in our nation somehow insignificant.  Amazing pic.twitter.com/4feVZv49DH    (@emotioneIIe) November 16, 2016One of the most race-obsessed teachers on social media that I have ever seen, posted this tweet to his Twitter account.

We ve had enough and we re pretty sure you have as well. It doesn t matter what the color of your skin is, this display of hate and racism is unacceptable from any publication. Buzzfeed should be ashamed of themselves for putting this crap out there, and then paying to promote it on a social media sites geared towards teens and young adults.Our final presenter is simply making the point that he is a victim. Can anyone guess who made him a victim? If your skin color is white, we re pretty sure it was you.Jose Lara at Ethnic Studies panel. #EthnicStudiesNow pic.twitter.com/ufX30bn9ZC  Mark Tschaepe (@mdtschaepe) October 30, 2015Radical publications like Buzzfeed are not the only problem. Many of our educators are also indoctrinating our children with the,  all white s are racists  narrative. When are parents going to start taking a stand, and tell the educators at the schools their children attend they are not going to stand by and watch them shame their children? It may be all the rage in high schools and colleges to unfairly accuse white people of racism and hate, but that doesn t mean you, or your kids have to go along with it.For the entire slide show, go to Buzzfeed. Make sure to leave a comment, and let them know how you feel about the garbage they re putting out to your kids disguised as  news.  Teenagers and young adults have a hard enough time dealing with self-image and everyday teenage insecurities. Suicide rates and depression are off the charts for teens.

It must be made clear to the whole world that the vast majority of people in the United States do not support his presidency or consent to his rule.Even though he won in a landslide. Have you seen the map?Trump stands for tyranny, greed, and misogyny. He is the champion of neo-nazis and white Nationalists, of the police who kill the Black, Brown and poor on a daily basis, of racist border agents and sadistic prison guards, of the FBI and NSA who tap your phone and read your email.He is the harbinger of even more climate catastrophe, deportation, discrimination, and endless war. He continues to deny the existence of climate change, in spite of all the evidence, putting the future of the whole human race at stake.The KKK, Vladimir Putin, Golden Dawn, and the Islamic State all cheered his victory. If we let his inauguration go unchallenged, we are opening the door to the future they envision.OOPS Wrong again! It looks like ISIS has the same, or similar plans:Trump s success confirms the bankruptcy of representative democracy. Rather than using the democratic process as an alibi for inaction, we must show that no election could legitimize his agenda. Neither the Democrats nor any other political party or politician will save us they just offer a weaker version of the same thing. If there is going to be a positive change in this society, we have to make it ourselves, together, through direct action.From day one, the Trump presidency will be a disaster. #DisruptJ20 will be the start of the resistance. We must take to the streets and protest, blockade, disrupt, intervene, sit in, walk out, rise up, and make more noise and good trouble than the establishment can bear. The parade must be stopped. We must delegitimize Trump and all he represents.

RICK SANTORUM INFURIATES LIBERALS After He Tells ILLEGAL ALIEN To Go Home And Apply For Citizenship [VIDEO],"What do you think? Do you agree with Rick Santorum, or should we allow illegal aliens to enjoy all of the same benefits as American citizens simply because they or their parents made it across our US border without getting caught?Former Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.) can t speak to whether President-elect Donald Trump plans to deport undocumented immigrants en masse beginning next year, but he has made one thing clear: People who came to the U.S. illegally as children, also known as Dreamers, should just leave the U.S. if they re worried about their immigration status.Elizabeth Vilchis, a mechanical engineer who said she came to the U.S. from Mexico when she was 7 years old, asked Santorum about Trump s immigration plans on Tuesday night during a town hall event with CNN s Van Jones. She asked Santorum how he would advise her to plan for her future.He began his reply by talking about his father, who left Mussolini s Italy to come to the U.S. when he was 7 years old   even though, Santorum said,  he wasn t allowed to come because of the immigration laws at the time. Then he began to address Vilchis specifically. What most people in America feel is that you ve been given a tremendous benefit by being here in this country,  Santorum said, adding that he imagined she wouldn t  have had to opportunities to accomplish what you have  in her country of origin. My final point is that you have the ability to go to any other country right now and apply those wares, and be successful, and reapply to come back to America,  Santorum added.  Go and make the world a better place. CNN contributor Ana Navarro butted in. First of all, this is your country,  she said.  No matter what he says, no matter what anybody else says, this is your country. That s not what the law says,  Santorum replied.

HIDDEN ORDER: Was the Death of Justice Scalia Linked to â€˜Secret Societyâ€™ at Cibolo Ranch?,"Shawn Helton   21st Century WireWith the United States in the heat of the 2016 presidential election cycle, key questions surrounding the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia continue to persist  as there s a new conspiratorial twist added to an already suspicious case.Recently, here at 21WIRE, we discussed many of the strange circumstances observed in the aftermath of Justice Scalia s death. The 79-year-old conservative justice was found dead in his hotel room at Cibolo Creek Ranch, a luxury ranch located in Presidio County, Texas.There was no official autopsy made by a medical examiner in Scalia s death, only a controversial pronouncement over the phone by Presidio County Judge Cinderela Guevara.As 21WIRE pointed out in an earlier report regarding Scalia, Guevara appears to have reversed her previous statement claiming that Scalia had died of a  heart attack , revising the cause of death to  natural causes.  Guevara s handling of the death scene of a Supreme Court Justice without being present has drawn sharp criticism from both the media and the public.  ORIGINAL MEANING  Controversial conservative firebrand, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. (Photo illustration 21WIRE)Secret Order, Secret Death?On February 24th, The Washington Post published an article entitled  Justice Scalia spent his last hours with members of this secretive society of elite hunters : When Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died 12 days ago at a West Texas ranch, he was among high-ranking members of an exclusive fraternity for hunters called the International Order of St. Hubertus, an Austrian society that dates back to the 1600s. Continuing, The Washington Post confirmed that indeed, the FBI will not be conducting an investigation into Supreme Court Justice Scalia s death. On an interesting note however, the article states that the FBI was unaware of the secretive international order all together: Law enforcement officials told The Post that they had no knowledge of the International Order of St. Hubertus or its connection to Poindexter and ranch guests. The officials said the FBI had declined to investigate Scalia s death when they were told by the marshals that he died from natural causes.   CLOAK & DAGGER    Members of The International Order of Saint Hubertus, from left: John Kotts, Boysie Bollinger, Vidal Martinez, Reed Morian and John Poindexter. (Photo link chron)The Washington Post article also revealed the identity of Scalia s travel partners:  C. Allen Foster, a prominent Washington lawyer who traveled to the ranch with Scalia by private plane,  and that Cibolo Creek Ranch owner John Poindexter, along with C. Allen Foster, had flown with Scalia to the ranch for the now infamous quail-hunting trip.Also according to the Post, both Poindexter and Foster,  hold leadership positions within the [Saint Hubertus] Order. It is unclear what, if any, official association Scalia had with the group. While the Post acknowledged that many of the 35 guests in attendance at Cibolo Creek Ranch have remained largely unknown to the public eye, they discuss some of the details surrounding the St. Hubertus order, an international brotherhood whose founding member, Count Franz Anton von Sporck , also started a branch of Freemasonry in Bohemia (now the Czech Republic): Members of the worldwide, male-only society wear dark-green robes emblazoned with a large cross and the motto  Deum Diligite Animalia Diligentes,  which means  Honoring God by honoring His creatures,  according to the group s website. The conspiratorial coincidence doesn t end there, it was also revealed that  The society s [Saint Hubertus] U.S. chapter launched in 1966 at the famous Bohemian Club in San Francisco.   CIBOLO CONSPIRACY    What really happened to Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. (Photo link twitter)Magic Bullets Become  Magic Pillows Another bizarre element to this story, was the description and discovery of Scalia s body when it was first found by Cibolo Creek ranch owner, Poindexter. This aspect of the story is illustrated very clearly in a passage from the blog Followship of the Minds: On February 14, 2016, in an article for mySA (MySanAntonio) titled,  Texas Ranch owner recalls Scalia s last hours, reporter John MacCormack quoted Poindexter: We discovered the judge in bed, a pillow over his head.Everything was in perfect order. He was in his pajamas, peacefully, in bed. His bed clothes were unwrinkled. He was lying very restfully. It looked like he had not quite awakened from a nap. On February 17, Poindexter  clarified  his comment to the New York Daily News that  There was a pillow over his head, not over his face. The face was entirely clear. And now, the latest.David Warren reports for the AP that according to a Presidio County Sheriff s Office incident report obtained by The Washington Post on Feb. 23, nothing appeared out of place around Scalia s bed. Three pillows were stacked to elevate Scalia s head. A top pillow appeared to have toppled onto his eyes and forehead but didn t appear positioned to impede his breathing.  Scalia s  arms were at his side atop the bed covers, which were pulled up to his chin. The bed covers were smooth and creased and showed no sign of a struggle. That is one magic pillow!First, it was over Scalia s head.Then, it was above Scalia s head, whose face was  entirely clear .Now, the pillow is neither over nor above Scalia s head, but partially covering his face ( toppled onto his eyes and forehead ), although the pillow made sure to position itself so as not to  impede his breathing .   SECRETS IN CIBOLO    The scenic surroundings of Cibolo Creek Ranch. (Photo link tripadvisor)While you have to wonder about the confusion surrounding Scalia s pillow placement, The Washington Post s recent eye-opening revelations regarding the Order of St. Hubertus   give us some other things to consider Silencing Conspiracy with ConspiracyThe overtly conspiracy-tinged Post piece is a rarity in the mainstream world, one that conjure s many Hollywood or government tales of murder, deception and intrigue throughout history.The acknowledgement of a decadent Eyes Wide Shut-like  secret society  on location at Cibolo Creek Ranch prior to Scalia s death, only enhances the drive by voyeurism witnessed since his passing and in a way, it could undermine any legitimate investigation into his death after the fact.While its true, this compelling new detail will most likely bring its lion s share of political protest, as well as predictable calls for congressional inquiry or a push for a federal investigation (as should be)   the heavily publicized presence of a secretive fraternal order of hunters nearby a suspicious crime scene, will unfortunately fuel more speculation.Put another way: Whether or not the secret group at Cibolo Creek Ranch was involved in Scalia s death, you have to wonder why the mainstream media revealed this latest conspiratorial element in the first place.Media gatekeepers in television, print and radio will have a field day with this new controversial piece, all the while pushing and pulling the population into a particular corner   and by the looks of it, that s already happening.Having said all of this however, there s still much to be concerned with regarding Scalia s highly suspicious death   OBAMA NO-SHOW    The funeral service for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Oddly, President Obama elected not to attend. (Photo link detroitnewstime)Big Questions RemainOver the years, Scalia s various political connections and political perspective on important issues earned him a controversial reputation.In 2014, Justice Scalia drew harsh criticism for his views on the CIA torture debate, when the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee released a report on the interrogation techniques used since the 9/11 attacks.Whether you agreed or disagreed with Scalia, it s important to note once again that the high court has several pending landmark cases on climate, abortion and immigration, all within weeks or months of his death.The NY Post s recent article entitled  Scalia could have been poisoned: forensic pathologist, raised even more questions about the state of Scalia s body upon being discovered: Lethal poisoning could have left Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia s body in virtually the same condition in which it was found, a top forensic pathologist [Dr. Michael Baden] told The Post on Wednesday.

The Android Affair: Humanity Outsourced,"Randy Johnson 21st Century WireThe future is coming and technology is coming with it.  Are we adapting to the future or holding on to  the old ways ?  Is a future of technology with circuit boards, screens, and machines something that can be weaponized or used to shape and control society  no different than gunpowder, nuclear energy, and marketing?To many, often considered great minds, technology and artificial intelligence has had an ominous role in science fiction in film and literature.  George Orwell, Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clark, and Philip K. Dick are some of the giants of this genre.  Their work has inspired countless Hollywood movies and television programs and can often get someone wondering if life is imitating art, or vice versa.  Another option is that nearly everything has an element of design all along. ANDROID AFFAIR: Big business and robotics (Image Source: WikiCommons)As far back as the 1927 film Metropolis, robotics, class segregation, industry, and even humanity itself, appear on a collision course.  Some might even argue that humanity, technology, and robotics, are already into an integration phase.Since then we know the not all inclusive list of characters.  The Space Odyssey 2001 s HAL 1000, Star Wars   human cyborg relations  C-3PO, Blade Runner s Nexus 6 Replicants, and the infamous Terminator.

Piling on to the prospects of a bleak future, Wired Magazine states,  Oxford University researchers have estimated that 47 percent of U.S. jobs could be automated within the next two decades. And if even half that number is closer to the mark, workers are in for a rude awakening. The impact of robotics in industry and its effects in the workforce has also been reported on here at 21st Century Wire.It is a foreboding thing to contemplate, but are we being outsourced?A robot will not call in sick or ask for a wage increase.  It will not fight with others unless programmed to.  It will not complain, throw a fit, collect unemployment, leave early, or join the workers union to fight the corporation.  Once integrated and a part of industry, it will save money.  It will not require an annual review.  When it becomes irrelevant to newer technology, it will be replaced.Getting to a robotic future will even  create new jobs  no doubt.

Syria Ceasefire Deal: A Cynical Ploy by Washingtonâ€™s â€˜Coalitionâ€™ to Buy Time for Terrorists,"21st Century Wire says This latest diplomatic development certainly appears positive on its surface, this week s declared  Syrian Ceasefire    a three-way agreement between Washington, Russia and the Syrian government (and begrudgingly by the West s other regional  stakeholders ) looks increasingly like it may just be the latest attempt to buy time   so that Washington, Turkey and Saudi Arabia can re-arm and replenish various militant fighting groups currently laying waste to Syria.Since the entrance of the Russian Air Force into the Syrian conflict theatre last October, the Washington-led Axis has gradually lost proxy-control of a number of key terrorist strongholds in Northern Syria, namely in Aleppo, and thus are unable to dictate crucial  facts on the ground  required to dictate the international media and political narratives. Unable to craft and package these narratives, the West and its dubious  coalition  are completely unable to sell an escalation of military violence in Syria.The fact that the Washington Axis has already threatened to move to a  Plan B    even before the agreement has been implemented, indicates that this diplomatic effort may in fact be  dead on arrival . Before the ink was even dry on the agreement, sources inside the CIA and the Pentagon went public with a preemptive statement claiming that,  Russia cannot be trusted to uphold the ceasefire .

Wikileaks: NSA Spied on UN Secretary-General and World Leadersâ€™ Secret Meetings," InverseWikileaks released tonight a new cache of documents, showing that the United States  National Security Administration bugged private meetings between major world leaders, including the United Nations Secretary General.The N.S.A. bugged meetings between U.N.S.G.

ENCRYPTION TRUTH: What The FBI Arenâ€™t Telling You About Their Battle With Apple And San Bernardino,"Shawn Helton 21st Century WireEarlier this week Apple CEO Tim Cook publicly rejected an unprecedented US Federal Court order that would force the company to decrypt an iPhone linked to one of the San Bernardino shooters   a move that would have vast implications  PRIVACY & PROTECTION: Apple CEO Tim Cook challenges FBI court order to unlock private data of users (Image Source: Iphoneitalia)Breaching Public Privacy In a published open letter entitled,  A Message to Our Customers,   Apple CEO Tim Cook strikingly opposed a recent federal court ruling that would unlock a phone that s been connected to the San Bernardino Mass Shooting case.The FBI ruling stipulates that Apple must provide access for one time only. However, cyber security experts and technology companies insist this is a virtual impossibility and a guarantee that cannot be made.In theory, the decryption of the phone would be opened via a newly created operating system that would give the FBI a backdoor into the device. But according to many skeptics, this type of backdoor feature could set a very dangerous precedent, while possibly making it much easier for invaders (either government, or hacker) mining for data well into the future.In addition, the new iOS (not yet in existence) proposed in the wake of the San Bernardino shooting would give US law enforcement agencies broader access to consumer communications and other private information according to many in the tech industry. This reality was confirmed by Apple s chief executive Cook, who outlined the staggering privacy implications this past Tuesday: The FBI wants us to make a new version of the iPhone operating system, circumventing several important security features, and install it on an iPhone recovered during the investigation. In the wrong hands, this software   which does not exist today   would have the potential to unlock any iPhone in someone s physical possession. In essence, the FBI s court order demand appears to bypass basic privacy rights, and when seen in a bigger picture outside of the San Bernardino case, it could be viewed as a violation of the public s 4th Amendment.Challenging The RulingOver the past 48 hours, there s been a social media frenzy, as Facebook, Twitter and Google have all expressed their support for Apple s court battle with federal authorities. This has also included the often entertaining if not perplexing, self-proclaimed  cybersecurity legend  John McAfee of McAfee Inc., who wrote an op-ed published with Business Insider, that dissects the potential fallout of the federal court ruling in similar fashion to that of Cook.Here s some of what the controversial cyber guru turned libertarian presidential hopeful had to say about the dire security circumstances facing Apple and the world at large: Using an obscure law, written in 1789   the All Writs Act   the US government has ordered Apple to place a back door into its iOS software so the FBI can decrypt information on an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters. It has finally come to this. After years of arguments by virtually every industry specialist that back doors will be a bigger boon to hackers and to our nation s enemies than publishing our nuclear codes and giving the keys to all of our military weapons to the Russians and the Chinese, our government has chosen, once again, not to listen to the minds that have created the glue that holds this world together. Continuing, cyber expert McAfee, offered up a glimpse what could transpire in the event of a blackmail scenario if such a digital backdoor were to exist: In spite of the FBI s claim that it would protect the back door, we all know that s impossible. There are bad apples everywhere, and there only needs to be in the US government. Then a few million dollars, some beautiful women (or men), and a yacht trip to the Caribbean might be all it takes for our enemies to have full access to our secrets.   ANTIVIRUS PIONEER    John McAfee, well-known American computer programmer. (Photo businessinsider) McAfee then summarized his op-ed with a ready-made-solution to the FBI s demands by offering his services, I will, free of charge, decrypt the information on the San Bernardino phone, with my team, over a three-week period.On the surface, a sensational gauntlet has been thrown down, calling for the court of public opinion to weigh in on a very important topic concerning privacy rights. But there s much more to it This latest  privacy crisis  might be viewed through a more cynical lens, should readers choose to view this drama as a story featuring controlled opposition   especially when considering the pedigree of those supposedly opposed to the FBI s recent court order.Is it possible that Apple and others have staged opposition to this court decree as a way to bolster their public image, before eventually allowing the rights of private citizens to be abused? Both Cook and McAfee have direct links to companies plagued with security baggage such as Lockheed Martin and IBM, both of which have had their ethics put to question over the years.While there is nothing conclusive here, the public should consider this other side to the story and eliminate inconvenient possibilities in an effort to find the reality of the present circumstances, even if high profile tech leaders may appear to be saying the right things in public, purportedly in the interest of the general population.In an article featured here at 21WIRE from January of 2015, we learned of another privacy threat that should concern the public regarding biometric IDs   as facial and emotional recognition software has already been rolled out without public consent: More Orwellian technology is being rolled out, not just to make you into more of a commodity than you already are, but also to  profile  your emotions. With no regulation on this issue, corporations are basically writing the privacy rules as they go along. Do you trust them? Where is this really heading? In realty, they have no control over how third parties using their software might use images of people s faces and digital signatures of your  emotions , storing, sharing and selling that data across macro platforms. Sure, it s just another new wing of Big Data. Even social media data trawlers like Facebook has already begun moving into facial recognition of their users. So while it is compelling, and quite welcome to hear tech giants calling out the FBI s overreach, it appears that many in the technology sector have already pledged support for a growing police state apparatus by virtue of developing privacy invading software. For the moment though, it appears technology innovators Cook and McAfee, along with other social media companies, seem to be working on behalf of the public s interest, even though it could be out of concern for marketability rather than true worry about where the field of technology has been heading.Apple s iPhone and tablets introduced a biometric ID system with its thumb print login scan in 2013   a system which will store millions of biometric identifiers on Apple cloud servers. It wasn t long after the system was launched before hackers cracked the security for this biometric entry point, exposing another unspeakable privacy breach.If nothing else, it has caused a sharp debate over this pressing subject.  DIGITAL DANGER    The battle for consumer privacy hangs in the balance over the recent FBI court order. (Photo vibratingupdate)Problem, Reaction, SolutionAccording to the Guardian: For months, the FBI searched for a compelling case that would force Apple to weaken iPhone security   and then the San Bernardino shooting happened. This carefully planned legal battle has been months in the making, US officials and tech executives told the Guardian, as the government and Apple try to settle whether national security can dictate how Silicon Valley writes computer code. This past December, those of us at 21WIRE, pointed out a number of inconsistencies relating the heavily dramatized San Bernardino shooting attack. In fact, the media driven shooting attack said to have taken place at the Inland Regional Center had a laundry list of details that didn t add up.After a week of whitewashed reports regarding the shooting, a media scripted ransacking of the alleged  shooters  home (tampering with a potential crime scene) and eyewitness accounts that directly contradicted the official narrative from law enforcement, we learned that in the very room where 14 people were reportedly killed (along with 21 injured) at the Inland Regional Center, there was an  active-shooter  training drill/rehearsal, involving some of the victims almost a year before December s attack to place.Incredibly, a critical component that should be mentioned in the encryption battle involving Apple and the FBI, is that there were multiple eye-witness accounts that directly contradicted the terror-tale blamed solely on Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik. In other words, we have an event largely hinged on a barrage of convoluted and conflicting accounts concerning the San Bernardino attack.The eye-witness accounts near the scene of the shooting, never mentioned anything about seeing a female shooter, which 21WIRE also noted this past December: In fact, authorities did apprehend a third suspect but that aspect of the case, has seemingly gone down the memory hole, as has the very detailed eye-witness testimony from Sally Abdelmageed, (an Inland Regional Center employee) in a CBS interview with Scott Pelley, which clearly states that there were three white men in tactical gear dressed in black involved in the shooting event. Abdelmageed s account, echoed that of Juan Hernandez, who was interviewed shortly after the shooting incident by a local NBC affiliate, where it was described that  three white men in military fatigues,  had fled the scene in black Chevy Impala or SUV. Despite all of this, CNN, ABC, FOX and all other media outlets on the scene   all pivoted, in unison, to validate authorities  (the FBI) revised official  Jihadi Bonnie & Clyde  story of  only 2 shooters   a husband and wife . Additionally, a close colleague from Inland Regional Center, Chris Nwadike, stated that Farook had been acting normal and that  he was quiet,  and that he had not had a disagreement with anyone at the center the day of the shooting. Furthermore, the FBI themselves revealed that both Malik and Farook had not posted radical messages on social media which had previously been reported by authorities (and dutifully repeated across the mainstream media).Even though the media eventually admitted that there were no  radical posts , the idea of  social media postings  became a central story line suggesting that Malik had somehow influenced Farook into participating in the attack. Regardless of what really happened, it seems that the FBI had the opening it needed to try to force open direct access into personal devices.Is it also possible the security agency wants access to the encrypted phone so they can plant an additional back story to a shooting case that never made any sense?Food for thought to chew on in today s digital age As the privacy vs. security battle moves forward, Reuters news agency reports: The U.S. Department of Justice filed a motion on Friday seeking to compel Apple Inc (AAPL.O) to comply with a judge s order to unlock the encrypted iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino shooters, portraying the tech giant s refusal as a  marketing strategy. The future of privacy hangs by a thread, as more and more divide and rule policies are being implemented at the expense of public freedoms.More to come on this story here at 21WIRE READ MORE SCI-TECH NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Sci-Tech FilesREAD MORE DAILY SHOOTER NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Daily Shooter Files",Middle-east,"February 20, 2016",Fake

GLOSSED OVER: Key Questions Emerge After Death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia,"21st Century Wire asks What really happened in the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia?With the United States deep in the throes of the 2016 presidential primaries, the sudden death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has provided a controversial backdrop to an already tense electoral race.Reports state that the 79-year-old conservative justice was found dead this past Saturday in his hotel room at Cibolo Creek Ranch, a luxury ranch located in Presidio County, Texas.  NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN    Several Hollywood films have been shot in the surrounding areas of Cibolo Creek Ranch, including the haunting motion picture No Country For Old Men. (Photo cctoaks.com)The San Antonio Express-News reported that ranch owner, John Poindexter, discovered Scalia s body three hours after first visiting the deceased jurist s hotel room at 8:30 in the morning on Saturday: We discovered the judge in bed, a pillow over his head. His bed clothes were unwrinkled,  the Cibolo Ranch owner told reporters on Monday.  He was lying very restfully. It looked like he had not quite awakened from a nap. As several days have now passed, various theories have surfaced in the aftermath of Scalia s death, causing Poindexter to further clarify his eyewitness account with the Daily News: There was a pillow over his head, not over his face,  said Poindexter.  The face was entirely clear. One of the most troubling aspects of Scalia s death, aside from lack of an autopsy being performed or that Presidio County Judge Cinderela Guevara pronounced the manner of his death over the phone without being present. Later, Guevara appears to have reversed her previous statement claiming that Scalia had died of a  heart attack , revising the cause of death to  natural causes . Resort owner and Democrat Party financier John Poindexter pictured with President Obama.It should also be noted that the resort owner, John Poindexter, is a prominent Democrat Party donor and Obama Award Winner.Another disturbing fact: Justice Scalia was a key vote in temporarily blocking the Clean Power Plan crafted by the White House, a set of new EPA climate regulations, as reported by The Atlantic: On Tuesday [February 9th], the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the rules should neither be implemented nor enforced until the high court itself heard their opponents  case. This was itself unprecedented: Never before had the Supreme Court stayed a set of regulations before a federal court even heard the initial case about them. With the Clean Power Plan looming, there are several upcoming and potentially historic  Supreme Court cases that could be impacted by Scalia s death.Over the years, some have questioned Scalia s various hunting trips and political connections as reported by the LA Times: Scalia engendered criticism in the past over his choice of partners on hunting trips. In 2001, he went on a pheasant hunting trip with the dean of a Kansas law school who was the lead attorney in two cases that were about to come before the Supreme Court. And in 2004, he went duck hunting with then-Vice President Dick Cheney   flying with him on a plane that served as Air Force 2  while the high court was considering a case that challenged the secrecy of an energy task force led by Cheney. Many questions still remain in the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia   which will no doubt prompt speculation well into the foreseeable future.No More Fake News reports below   TIPPING THE BALANCE    Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.  (Photo dallasnews)By John RappoportLet s jump right in with quotes from the Washington Post, 2/15,  Conspiracy theories swirl around the death of Antonin Scalia . The Post published extraordinary statements from the Facebook page of  William O. Ritchie, former head of criminal investigations for D.C. police : As a former homicide commander, I am stunned that no autopsy was ordered for Justice Scalia. You have a Supreme Court Justice who died, not in attendance of a physician. You have a non-homicide trained US Marshal tell the justice of peace that no foul play was observed. You have a justice of the peace pronounce death while not being on the scene and without any medical training opining that the justice died of a heart attack. What medical proof exists of a myocardial Infarction? Why not a cerebral hemorrhage? How can the Marshal say, without a thorough post mortem, that he was not injected with an illegal substance that would simulate a heart attack Did the US Marshal check for petechial hemorrhage in his eyes or under his lips that would have suggested suffocation? Did the US Marshal smell his breath for any unusual odor that might suggest poisoning? My gut tells me there is something fishy going on in Texas. If this isn t enough, the Post goes on: Scalia s physician, Brian Monahan, is a U.S. Navy rear admiral and the attending physician for the U.S. Congress and Supreme Court. He declined to comment on Scalia s [prior] health when reached by telephone Monday at his home in Maryland. Patient confidentiality forbids me to make any comment on the subject,  he said. When asked whether he planned to make public the statement he s preparing for [Texas Judge] Guevara, Monahan repeated the same statement and hung up on a reporter. As long as no law-enforcement investigation of Scalia s death is launched, the doctor is justified. Confidentiality applies, unless Scalia s family lifts it. But if such an investigation is opened, all bets are off. Confidentiality no longer applies.There are reports that, after Scalia s body was transported from the celebrity ranch in Texas, closely guarded and shielded by a bevy of marshals, it was rapidly embalmed. If so, that would apparently make toxicological tests far more difficult or impossible.As for a murder motive, try: upsetting the voting balance of the US Supreme Court. Try: a push to appoint a new Justice now, thus ensuring the appointee s political persuasion, regardless of the outcome of the 2016 Presidential election.Continue this story at No More Fake NewsREAD MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files",Middle-east,"February 17, 2016",Fake

"Arizona Rancher Protesting in Oregon is Targeted by CPS, Loses Custody of Foster Children","RTOne of the most visible members of the armed militia that took over a wildlife refuge in Oregon says his four foster sons were taken away due to his involvement in the standoff, and he blames the federal government who  must have gotten to the governor. Robert  LaVoy  Finicum and his wife Jeanette have fostered more than 50 boys over the last decade at their ranch near Chino Valley, Arizona. The couple is licensed and has a care contract with the Catholic Charities Community Services. Many of the children came from mental hospitals, drug rehabs and group homes for emotionally distressed youth, he told Oregon Public Broadcasting (OPB). IMAGE: Robert  LaVoy  Finicum. My ranch has been a great tool for these boys,  Finicum said.  It has done a lot of good. He traveled to Oregon to take part in the takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge at the beginning of January, leaving Jeanette to care for the four boys. But now the Finicums have no more fosters to care for.A social worker began removing the last four of the family s foster kids on January 4, the fourth day of the Oregon standoff. The last left five days later, he said. They didn t go out at the same time,  Finicum said.  One was there for a year, one of the boys was there six months, another eight months, and a month. I don t know where they ended up. He blamed the kids  removals on pressure from the feds. They were ripped from my wife,  Finicum said.  We are very successful [foster parents]. Our track records are good, it s been a good relationship. [Federal authorities] must have gotten to the governor, who told the state to get them out of there.

#Hashtag Hell & The Fake Left," By Dady Chery and Gilbert MercierAll writers with a desire to rattle people out of their torpor occasionally wonder if it is worthwhile to continue to try to raise their voices over the din of lies and distractions.More and more for us, such thoughts are occasioned, not by the mainstream, which predictably treats all the pronouncements from the powerful as being newsworthy, but by the fake left, which lobotomizes most of whom it touches. The increasing sophistication of this group and its rate of expansion are astounding. Its purpose is to annihilate and replace the real left, and it is making great strides in this regard.The real left includes those who, like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (MLK), came to realize that quantum leaps are the way to proceed, rather than tiny incremental change. The real left does not curry favor or approval from those in power; it challenges the social status quo and respects the inherent right of an injured and indignant population to rebel against authority. It is not for rent or for sale, and it does not cave in to power. Martin Luther King March (Image Source: Wikicommons)By contrast, the motivations of the fake left are money and fame: the preservation of their place in their ivory towers, together with all the trimmings of an upper middle class or wealthy lifestyle. For them, the path is smoothed and the wheels of the machine are oiled for lucrative book deals, speaking tours, radio and television interviews, and articles that are infinitely reverberated through approved sites in the Internet. Their spokespeople channel political ideas toward electoral cycles and transform revolutionary musings into banalities, paralysis, and futile actions. They attack the public s thought process itself and engender an attention-deficit disorder. Ideas are not pursued, shared, honed, and acted upon but instead displaced by fleeting slogans like  hope and change,  or  feel the Bern. Alternatively, the ideas are muddled, branded and labeled with names like  shock doctrine,   disaster capitalism,  or  climate capitalism,  so that they may be put away and no longer examined. An important function of the fake left is to diffuse legitimate, spontaneous defense. Righteous anger is made to give way to confusion, and the impetus to revolt is transformed into the futility of virtual actions. Slogans are used as vaccines to prevent the contagion of dissent. Thoughts, not quite fully formed and the beginning of spontaneous actions, like blockage of bridges and highways, quickly dissipate. They are aborted into quick visual scans of an image or rapidly associated with a few words, like  black lives matter,  and then shared on social media. Today, Thomas Paine s Common Sense would not kindle a revolution; instead it would be quoted, posted, pinned, and tweeted. The fake left is a decoy: a hunter s trap to break the leg of any possible revolution. One of the fake left s godfathers is the multibillionaire George Soros, who obviously believes that wealth equals wisdom and has come up with a clever model to launder his vast financial gains into global political influence. Soros has developed an extremely diversified portfolio of intellectual properties and non-governmental organizations (NGO) in more than 37 countries. Artists throughout the world who present their people as victims, and promote passivity and despair, are rewarded with support and prestigious prizes. Supported organizations like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International are accused not only of selectively collecting data on human rights abuses but also of exploiting some of those data to pressure countries into policy changes that are unrelated to human rights. Independent  journalism is a major focus of Soros  Open Society Foundation, which was founded in 1993, soon after the collapse of the Soviet Union and right before the explosion of the Internet. When US-friendly corrupt governments, and US-sponsored institutions like USAID and the United Nations are exposed by the real left, Soros-sponsored think tanks and news organizations like the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) spring into action and become the voice of reason, demanding that these organizations self-reform. Countless others, also related to the Open Society Foundation, echo and amplify their message. Dismantlement and profound systemic change are never on the agenda. In most of the world, and especially the US, elections are staged, with the primary goal being to let off steam from targeted sectors of the population. A secondary goal is to make a rigged political process appear believable and give the impression of a free exchange of ideas. The candidates are presented as caricatures that trigger an emotional identification in specific groups of people. In the US in 2016, the mean, misogynist and racist ugly American stereotype is served well by Donald Trump for the right. On the other side, the reincarnated Occupy leftist champion of social justice is played by Bernie Sanders. Nonetheless it is Hillary Clinton s turn to win. Trump and Sanders serve to keep the elections in the news and to make Clinton the only supposed pragmatic choice. The ambition of Sanders to beat Hillary Clinton is questionable in light of the fact that he did not run for the presidency in 2012, although the issues were the same, and he could have benefited then from the energy of Occupy. Sander s platform is a reactivation of the Occupy themes. Occupy, however, is not what it used to be. Indeed it is a perfect example of something from the real left that was hijacked. It began as a leaderless anti-capitalist movement called US Day of Rage, but soon it acquired leaders like Chris Hedges, and its most radical elements, like the Black Bloc anarchists, were vilified and excluded. The fake left poaches the narrative of the real left so as to kill it. Outright plagiarism and abundant appropriations and rewrites are hallmarks of the fake left.  Since it lacks a heartfelt leftist rhetoric, it must continually borrow one, ironically, to excoriate it so as to present a superficial version of it. Any critical examination will show that the self-proclaimed firebrands of the left have, for decades, never moved the revolutionary dial an iota. If books like Noam Chomsky s Occupy or Naomi Klein s Shock Doctrine, or Chris Hedges and Joe Sacco s Days of Destruction, Days of Revolt had been genuine, they would have brought people to the barricades in the streets, and there would surely have been attempts to suppress them. Instead the books have been celebrated and glorified by the media establishment, because these pseudo-radical manifestos have not brought action but paralysis.The latest offering by Naomi Klein, This Changes Everything, will, by design, change absolutely nothing at all, except the balance of her bank account. TOAST OF THE LEFT: Author Naomi Klein.Those few of us who are genuinely trying to change the course of events sometimes wonder how we can compete against this powerful new machine that appropriates our message, twists it, and then blasts a degraded version of it through countless bullhorns. Doesn t the public realize that wealth and fame are not the normal trappings of revolutionaries? Don t people know that revolution is never easy, and that if it appears to be, it is not real? If words like earth, nature, life, democracy, dissent, protest, love, and revolution are allowed to lose their weight, our voices will go the way of the song of the extinct Dodo bird. It is imperative that these words be reappropriated and reinfused with meaning.Revolutionary talk cannot be permitted to become an exercise in futile venting or a validation of passivity; to mean anything at all, it must be enacted in community.Dady Chery is the author of We Have Dared to Be Free, and Gilbert Mercier is the author of The Orwellian Empire.

Astroturfing: Journalist Reveals Brainwashing Tactic Uses to Manipulate Public Opinion,"Vic Bishop Waking TimesOur reality is carefully constructed by powerful corporate, political and special interest sources in order to covertly sway public opinion. Blatant lies are often televised regarding terrorism, food, war, health, etc. They are fashioned to sway public opinion and condition viewers to accept what have become destructive societal norms.The practice of manipulating and controlling public opinion with distorted media messages has become so common that there is a whole industry formed around this. The entire role of this brainwashing industry is to figure out how to spin information to journalists, similar to the lobbying of government. It is never really clear just how much truth the journalists receive because the news industry has become complacent. The messages that it presents are shaped by corporate powers who often spend millions on advertising with the six conglomerates that own 90% of the media:General Electric (GE), News-Corp, Disney, Viacom, Time Warner, and CBS. Yet, these corporations function under many different brands, such as FOX, ABC, CNN, Comcast, Wall Street Journal, etc, giving people the perception of choice   As Tavistock s researchers showed, it was important that the victims of mass brainwashing not be aware that their environment was being controlled; there should thus be a vast number of sources for information, whose messages could be varied slightly, so as to mask the sense of external control. ~ Specialist of mass brainwashing, L. WolfeNew Brainwashing Tactic Called AstroturfWith alternative media on the rise, the propaganda machine continues to expand. Below is a video of Sharyl Attkisson, investigative reporter with CBS, during which she explains how  astroturf,  or fake grassroots movements, are used to spin information not only to influence journalists but to sway public opinion. Astroturf is a perversion of grassroots. Astroturf is when political, corporate or other special interests disguise themselves and publish blogs, start facebook and twitter accounts, publish ads, letters to the editor, or simply post comments online, to try to fool you into thinking an independent or grassroots movement is speaking. ~ Sharyl Attkisson, Investigative ReporterHow do you separate fact from fiction? Sharyl Attkisson finishes her talk with some insights on how to identify signs of propaganda and astroturfing  These methods are used to give people the impression that there is widespread support for an agenda, when, in reality, one may not exist. Astroturf tactics are also used to discredit or criticize those that disagree with certain agendas, using stereotypical names such as conspiracy theorist or quack. When in fact when someone dares to reveal the truth or questions the  official  story, it should spark a deeper curiosity and encourage further scrutiny of the information.This article (Journalist Reveals Tactics Brainwashing Industry Uses to Manipulate the Public) was originally created and published by Waking Times and is published here under a Creative Commons license with attribution to Vic Bishop and WakingTimes.com.

The New American Century: An Era of Fraud,"Paul Craig RobertsIn the last years of the 20th century fraud entered US foreign policy in a new way.  On false pretenses Washington dismantled Yugoslavia and Serbia in order to advance an undeclared agenda. In the 21st century this fraud multiplied many times. Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, and Libya were destroyed, and Iran and Syria would also have been destroyed if the President of Russia had not prevented it.  Washington is also behind the current destruction of Yemen, and Washington has enabled and financed the Israeli destruction of Palestine.  Additionally, Washington operated militarily within Pakistan without declaring war, murdering many women, children, and village elders under the guise of  combating terrorism.  Washington s war crimes rival those of any country in history.I have documented these crimes in my columns and books (Clarity Press). Anyone who still believes in the purity of Washington s foreign policy is a lost soul  Russia and China now have a strategic alliance that is too strong for Washington. Russia and China will prevent Washington from further encroachments on their security and national interests. Those countries important to Russia and China will be protected by the alliance.  As the world wakes up and sees the evil that the West represents, more countries will seek the protection of Russia and China.America is also failing on the economic front.  My columns and my book, The Failure of Laissez Faire Capitalism, which has been published in English, Chinese, Korean, Czech, and German, have shown how Washington has stood aside, indeed cheering it on, while the short-term profit interests of management, shareholders, and Wall Street eviscerated the American economy, sending manufacturing jobs, business know-how, and technology, along with professional tradeable skill jobs, to China, India, and other countries, leaving America with such a hollowed out economy that the median family income has been falling for years. Today 50% of 25 year-old Americans are living with their parents or grandparents because they cannot find employment sufficient to sustain an independent existance.This brutal fact is covered up by the presstitute US media, a source of fantasy stories of America s economic recovery.The facts of our existence are so different from what is reported that I am astonished. As a former professor of economics, Wall Street Journal editor and Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy, I am astonished at the corruption that rules in the financial sector, the Treasury, the financial regulatory agencies, and the Federal Reserve.  In my day, there would have been indictments and prison sentences of bankers and high government officials.In America today there are no free financial markets.  All the markets are rigged by the Federal Reserve and the Treasury. The regulatory agencies, controlled by those the agencies are supposed to regulate, turn a blind eye, and even if they did not, they are helpless to enforce any law, because private interests are more powerful than the law.Even the government s statistical agencies have been corrupted. Inflation measures have been concocted in order to understate inflation. This lie not only saves Washington from paying Social Security cost-of-living adjustments and frees the money for more wars, but also by understating inflation, the government can create real GDP growth by counting inflation as real growth, just as the government creates 5% unemployment by not counting any discouraged workers who have looked for jobs until they can no longer afford the cost of looking and give up.  The official unemployment rate is 5%, but no one can find a job.  How can the unemployment rate be 5% when half of 25-year olds are living with relatives because they cannot afford an independent existence?  As John Williams (shadowfacts) reports, the unemployment rate that includes those Americans who have given up looking for a job because there are no jobs to be found is 23%.The Federal Reserve, a tool of a small handful of banks, has succeeded in creating the illusion of an economic recovery since June, 2009, by printing trillions of dollars that found their way not into the economy but into the prices of financial assets.  Artificially booming stock and bond markets are the presstitute financial media s  proof  of a booming economy.The handful of learned people that America has left, and it is only a small handful, understand that there has been no recovery from the previous recession and that a new downturn is upon us.  John Williams has pointed out that US industrial production, when properly adjusted for inflation, has never recovered its 2008 level, much less its 2000 peak, and has again turned down.The American consumer is exhausted, overwhelmed by debt and lack of income growth. The entire economic policy of America is focused on saving a handful of NY banks, not on saving the American economy.Economists and other Wall Street shills will dismiss the decline in industrial production as America is now a service economy. Economists pretend that these are high-tech services of the New Economy, but in fact waitresses, bartenders, part time retail clerks, and ambulatory health care services have replaced manufacturing and engineering jobs at a fraction of the pay, thus collapsing effective aggregate demand in the US. On occasions when neoliberal economists recognize problems, they blame them on China.It is unclear that the US economy can be revived. To revive the US economy would require the re-regulation of the financial system and the recall of the jobs and US GDP that offshoring gave to foreign countries. It would require, as Michael Hudson demonstrates in his new book, Killing the Host, a revolution in tax policy that would prevent the financial sector from extracting economic surplus and capitalizing it in debt obligations paying interest to the financial sector.The US government, controlled as it is by corrupt economic interests, would never permit policies that impinged on executive bonuses and Wall Street profits.  Today US capitalism makes its money by selling out the American economy and the people dependent upon it.In  freedom and democracy  America, the government and the economy serve interests totally removed from the interests of the American people. The sellout of the American people is protected by a huge canopy of propaganda provided by free market economists and financial presstitutes paid to lie for their living.When America fails, so will Washington s vassal states in Europe, Canada, Australia, and Japan.  Unless Washington destroys the world in nuclear war, the world will be remade, and the corrupt and dissolute West will be an insignificant part of the new world.Dr. Paul Craig Roberts was Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy and associate editor of the Wall Street Journal. He was columnist for Business Week, Scripps Howard News Service, and Creators Syndicate. He has had many university appointments. His internet columns have attracted a worldwide following. Roberts  latest books are The Failure of Laissez Faire Capitalism and Economic Dissolution of the West, How America Was Lost, and The Neoconservative Threat to World Order.

Hillary Clinton: â€˜Israel Firstâ€™ (and no peace for Middle East),"Robert Fantina CounterpunchAlthough the United States is still ten months from its next exercise in electoral futility, most polls do not indicate what former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is most anxious to see: a runaway victory for her candidacy. It is a good sign that, despite the fact that she has no real contrasting opponent on the Democratic side, the coronation she expected isn t going to happen.One might say that this writer focuses too much on Mrs. Clinton s adoration of Israel. But by looking at her comments about that apartheid nation, one gets a clear view of some broader, very troubling perspectives that Mrs. Clinton seems to hold.On January 6, an opinion piece appeared in The Jewish Journal, written by Mrs. Clinton. It is a fawning, maudlin essay, typical of the writing of anyone seeking national political office in the U.S. who knows they must pay homage to their Israeli lord and master. A few points from this essay tell much about Mrs. Clinton. I m especially concerned about the new wave of violence inside Israel itself   brutal stabbings, shootings, and vehicle attacks that seek to sow fear among the innocent. The number of Palestinians killed in the West Bank alone by settler and IOF (Israel Occupation Force) terrorists is at a ten-year high. Why is Mrs. Clinton not  especially concerned  about the continuing wave of violence against Palestinians, in an area that even the U.S. says Israel occupies illegally? Do not these vicious attacks  seek to sow fear among the innocent ? Only a two-state solution negotiated between the parties can provide Palestinians independence, sovereignty, and dignity, and provide Israelis the secure and recognized borders of a democratic Jewish state. Why, oh why, does Mrs. Clinton continue to make this ridiculous statement? The borders of the Jewish state are recognized by most of the world, including the United Nations, and consist of those determined prior to 1967. There is nothing to negotiate. Does Mrs. Clinton disdain international law? It appears that she feels Israel, like the U.S. in its international dealings, is, indeed, above the law. BIBI FIRST: Hillary Clinton will never tell Israel  no .And this writer must point out, once again, that negotiations, which have proceeded on and off for twenty years or so, can only be effective when each side wants something the other has, that it can only obtain by surrendering something it has. Israel wants all of Palestine, and takes it, piece by piece, with complete impunity. Why should Palestine agree to pointless negotiations?Mrs. Clinton refers to the  secure and recognized  borders of a Jewish state, but does not seem to consider the  secure and recognized  borders of a Palestinian state. We must continue to fight against global efforts to delegitimize Israel. The Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, known as BDS, is the latest front in this battle. BDS demonizes Israeli scientists and intellectuals even young students and compares Israel to South African apartheid.  That s wrong and this campaign should end. The most significant efforts to delegitimize Israel are made by Israel itself. Its racist society, wherein Israeli Jews have more rights than anyone else in Israel; its apartheid system of segregation; its complete disdain for the human rights of the Palestinians; the racist, murderous statements made by government officials all further delegitimize the country, and demonize it, and rightly so. Israel is often compared to South African apartheid, and the comparison is valid.And it is not just in the context of Palestine and Israel that Mrs. Clinton demonstrates either gross ignorance, or gross dishonesty. Her essay also contained these pearls of wisdom: We must work with our friends and partners to deny ISIS territory in the Middle East, dismantle the global infrastructure of terror, and toughen our defenses at home.  We can t just contain ISIS   we must defeat ISIS. Is that really the U.S. s goal? Garikai Chengu, a researcher at Harvard University, suggested in September of 2014 that ISIS  is made-in-the-USA, an instrument of terror designed to divide and conquer the oil-rich Middle East and to counter Iran s growing influence in the region. In a June, 2015 column in The Guardian, Associate Editor Seumas Milne said this:  [T]he U.S. and its allies weren t only supporting and arming an opposition they knew to be dominated by extreme sectarian groups; they were prepared to countenance the creation of some sort of  Islamic state    despite the  grave danger  to Iraq s unity   as a Sunni buffer to weaken Syria.

McPain: John McCain Furious That Iran Treated US Sailors Well,"21st Century Wire says As 21WIRE reported earlier this week, the unlikely  mishap  of two US Naval vessels straying into Iranian waters   just hours before the President s State of the Union speech, followed by the usual parade of arch-neocons coming on TV in real time to declare the incident as  an act of aggression  by Iran against the United States   is no mere coincidence.24 hours after the incident, the Iranians returned all 11 US sailors, unharmed and in good spirits. The only remaining casualty from this event was an incident of a common condition in Washington known as  Pre-Traumatic Stress Disorder    suffered by a certain US Senator was mortified by the uneventful outcome which followed Daniel McAdams Ron Paul Institute  The two US Navy riverine command boats intercepted in Iranian territorial waters yesterday were sent on their way along with the crew of 10 US sailors after brief detention on Iranian soil.According to news reports, the well-armed warships either suffered mechanical or navigational difficulties which caused them to enter Iranian territory (although it may well have been a game of cat-and-mouse to test the Iranian response). The US sailors were apparently treated well, enjoyed what appeared a decent meal in relaxed surroundings, and in the end apologized for the mistake and praised their treatment by the Iranians. Thanks to President Obama s policy shift on Iran toward engagement and away from isolationism, Secretary of State John Kerry was able to telephone his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Zarif and quickly defuse what just months ago would have been a far more serious situation.This should be a good-news story about the value of diplomacy and reducing tensions with adversaries, but Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) was having none of it. That Kerry expressed his appreciation to the Iranians for swiftly releasing the American sailors only showed the Obama Administration s  craven desire to preserve the dangerous Iranian nuclear deal at all costs evidently knows no limit,  said McCain in a press release.McCain was furious that  Obama administration officials seem to be falling over themselves to offer praise for Iran s graciousness  and was outraged that the Iranians dared interfere with the actions of US military vessels operating in Iranian waters.In the world of John McCain, only the United States has the right to national sovereignty. The US military has the right to act anywhere and everywhere and the rest of the world dare not raise a question.According to McCain,  sovereign immune naval vessels are exempt from detention, boarding, or search. Their crews are not subject to detention or arrest. Imagine the tune McCain would have been singing if a well-armed Iranian naval vessel had been spotted in US territorial waters off the coast of New York. Would he have so rigorously condemned any US interference in the actions of Iran s sovereign naval vessels?Leave it to some clever Twitterers to post an example of the difference between US and Iranian detention.Copyright   2016 by RonPaul Institute.

"JUSTICE? Yahoo Settles E-mail Privacy Class-action: $4M for Lawyers, $0 for Users","21st Century Wire says It s a familiar theme. Whenever there is a dispute or a change of law, and two tribes go to war, there is normally only one real winner after the tribulation  the lawyers. Ars TechnicaIn late 2013, Yahoo was hit with six lawsuits over its practice of using automated scans of e-mail to produce targeted ads. The cases, which were consolidated in federal court, all argued that the privacy rights of non-Yahoo users, who  did not consent to Yahoo s interception and scanning of their emails,  were being violated by a multi-billion dollar company.Now, lawyers representing the plaintiffs are singing a different tune. Last week, they asked US District Judge Lucy Koh to accept a proposed settlement (PDF). Under the proposal, the massive class of non-Yahoo users won t get any payment, but the class lawyers at Girard Gibbs and Kaplan Fox intend to ask for up to $4 million in fees. (The ultimate amount of fees will be up to the judge, but Yahoo has agreed not to oppose any fee request up to $4 million.)While users won t get any payment, Yahoo will change how it handles user e-mails but it isn t the change that the plaintiffs attorneys were originally asking for. Yahoo won t stop scanning e-mails. Instead, the company has agreed to make a technical change to when it scans e-mails. In the settlement (PDF), Yahoo has agreed that e-mail content will be  only sent to servers for analysis for advertising purposes after a Yahoo Mail user can access the email in his or her inbox.

Sunnistan: US and Allied â€˜Safe Zoneâ€™ Plan to Take Territorial Booty in Northern Syria,"Patrick Henningsen  21st Century WireRemember when the Obama Administration told the world how it hoped to identify 5,000 reliable non-jihadist  moderate  rebels hanging out in Turkey and Jordan, who might want to fight for Washington in Syria? After all the drama over its infamous  train and equip  program to create their own Arab army in Syria, they want to give it another try.This week, Pentagon officials announced their new plan to train up to 7,000 more  moderate  fighters, but this time the project would take place inside Syria (and to hell with international law).We re told that this was requested by Ankara, and with all NATO allies singing the same hymn   claiming that this new effort will help in securing Turkey s porous border with Syria, or so the story goes. Washington s political cover for this is fashioned from the popular post-Paris theme: to protect civilized Europe from invading hordes and the terrorists who hide among them, as stated in the Wall Street Journal: The program would address part of the tense and long-running dialogue between Washington and Ankara over sealing the border, which Western governments have long complained is an avenue for extremists to leave Syria and travel internationally, The timing of this announcement seemed uncanny against the backdrop of an unlikely ISIS  suicide bomb  terrorist attack, in Turkey, of all places, where the victims just happened to be 14 German tourists, feeding perfectly into Europe s new binary fear set of terrorism and immigration. Shades of GLADIO, undoubtedly (but you won t see western journalists entertaining such conspiracy theories).Our friends at Nation Builders Inc are banking on the global public suffering from Syria fatigue, but now is the time to really pay attention. The west s real agenda for the region is starting to unfold Despite all of US-led Coalition s scandals, lies, epic failures, false flags and official conspiracy theories, the mainstream narrative on Syria persists. It s on our TV screens and in our newspapers constantly   from Los Angeles to London, from Paris to Riyadh, every politician and pundit seems to have an opinion about,  what to do with Syria?  Everyone, except the Syria people  themselves, who like the people of Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, Yemen and ever other country that s found itself under the cleaver of western interests   are never afforded any say in their own destiny. As is tradition in Washington, London and Paris, the only Syrian voices which count are the ones who have been hand-picked by western technocrats and approved by the Saudi royal family to form their ever-changing  recognized  government-in-exile, the Syrian National Council. Currently, that could be Riad Hijab,  George Sabra or Khaled Khoja. Next week, it could be three others, depending on who has fallen in, or out of favor with Washington or Riyadh.To anyone who was listening close enough early on in the conflict, you would have heard determined members of the western-backed  Syrian Opposition  admitting how they would,  make a deal with the devil if that s what it takes to win power.  Four years later, we now see that is exactly what happened, but whether you believe that this  devil is US-led Coalition, or terrorist armies fighting groups (or both) might be cause for debate. Others will argue over which is the bigger devil   is it the Wahabist-Salafist terrorist brigades like al Nusra Front and Islamic State, or is it the West and its GCC partners?The unfortunate reality is that these two devils are not mutually exclusive. The West and its partners not only created this  terror  crisis, but did so with the intent of unveiling a grand  solution  to the problem.Plans A-ZThe terrorist enclave in Syria is designed for purpose   to implant a hostile metastasis right in the middle of the very territory which neocolonial powers plan to tear away from the barely sovereign nations of Iraq and Syria.Since 2011, the western-led cartel has deployed various levels of international subterfuge in Syria, starting with Plan A: the Arab Spring method   igniting a popular street uprising that might capture the world s attention for 15 minutes   enough to generate some high-quality evocative imagery and a social media storm to carry memes of liberty around the globe, inspiring the people on the streets (and on Twitter) to demand  change . Their cries for freedom would then be backed up by the US State Department, along with its functionaries at Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International America, and other Open Society Institute-funded NGOs and  human rights  organizations. Obviously, this did not work. Next, Plan B: the political opposition suddenly transcended into an armed, paramilitary opposition, followed by brutal violence and killing on both sides. The US and its allies wasted no time, pledging weapons, training, cash and logistical support to the armed opposition. The west set up its own parallel government for Syria abroad, but it failed to gain any traction with the Syria people. Then came Plan C: this  opposition  would be quickly overrun and absorbed into a massive array of mostly foreign jihadi and mercenary soldiers of misfortune and other assorted terrorists. This fed into an already established  War on Terror  western narrative. Now the west had a familiar entry point into the fight. The Washington-London-Paris-Tel-Aviv-Riyadh-Doha-Ankara Axis hoped that these terrorists would do the job of overthrowing the government of Bashar al Assad in Damascus, and collapse the country into a spirally pit of sectarian and tribal chaos. Who could blame them? After all, it worked in Libya in late 2011.Fast forward to 2016, having failed to overthrow Assad and implode the nation-state of Syria, the men and women of Nation Builders Inc and their muscles in Brussels (NATO), are quickly moving to Plan D: take territory. That s not to say plans A through D weren t always in the schematics   they certainly were, and further back than many people would dare to speculate.We now know from Wikileaks cables that this operation goes back to at least 2006, but in reality, it s probably much earlier than that. Taking the long view of history and the audacious building, and rebuilding, of a Euro-centric empire in the Middle East, one could say the process began the day the Sykes-Picot Agreement was signed in 1916. Concealed between those post-colonial lines drawn exactly 100 years ago, was the latent potential for the very conflicts and uncivil wars we are seeing today. If those borders are redrawn once again, you can be certain that they will be drawn by the very same powers involved a century ago. Whatever the arrangement, it will be to weaken, not strengthen the region, and certainly not strengthen any of the present nation states in the region, especially Syria. Proprietary powers will want any new states to be stuck in a perpetual state of neocolonial dependency, with an emphasis on financial and security dependency.Mice and Men21WIRE was one of the first news sources to warn about Washington s initial impulse back in 2014 when it began calling for a  No Fly Zone  in Northern Syria. It was clear that a problem, reaction, solution dialectic was in play, with ISIS being the object of the public s reaction. That plan might have come to fruition in the fall of 2015, but a funny thing happened on the way to the UN General Assembly in New York City. Later that week, Russia announced that it would be inserting itself, and its Air Force, into the Syrian quagmire, and with that, thwarted any master plan for a US-Turkey (NATO) controlled No Fly Zone along the Turkish-Syrian border. Suffice to say, that Russia already knew NATO s next move and acted accordingly, and with purpose.When asked two days ago about the prospect of the Washington DC latest brainchild, Train and Equip 2.0, this time inside Syria, here were my initial thoughts: We now know why, and it has more to do with what s beneath the sand than what s on top.As any good pirate will tell you   if you want to claim your share of the booty, you have to do your share of the killing. The Truth About  Train and Equip The previous  train and equip  program ended with Washington s military brass paraded in front of the Senate Armed Services Committee, before being roundly lambasted for failing to train even a handful of  moderate rebels , this after being awarded $500 million by the US taxpayer to get er done. When originally announced amid much fanfare, the public were told that the US government, in conjunction with the CIA, would be arming and training  moderate  militants in Turkey, Jordan or at a base in Saudi Arabia   before sending them to fight inside Syria. Washington claims that these new trainees were meant to fight ISIS, and not the Syrian government forces, but judging by the unwavering  regime change  rhetoric from the west, it would be highly naive to think that all this was strictly for ISIS.Nine months into the train and equip project, US Army Gen. Lloyd Austin III, acknowledged in Sept. 2015 that they had only managed to get  four or five  on the battlefield by then. Not one member of the media challenged this statement, probably because most were happy with the answer given   one which gave any hawkish critics of the Obama administration the pound of flesh they wanted and served to only intensify more calls before the new year for US  boots on the ground  in Syria. Doves loved it because it seemed to prove that backing proxies doesn t work, and that the best solution was to call it quits. For the sanguine mainstream media, it served-up that all-too familiar government narrative, of a  cock-up, not a cover-up.  This is the media s natural default position. In other words,  Well, it didn t work out, but that s nothing new with our incompetent government. Nothing to see here, move along.  To ask how the money disappeared, or really inquire into how it costs $500 million to train only five men   apparently was way too much work for the media. Not one  journalist  stopped to ask, if only 5 fighters were trained and dispatched, then what happened to the half a billion dollars?The real answer to that question should be self-evident to anyone studying reports on the ground in Syria, and is way too uncomfortable for the US media to stomach   that the US  train and equip  program provided the necessary official cover to allow the prosecution of a dirty war under the table. It wasn t a failure like fall guy Gen. Lloyd Austin will have you believe, it was a success.Judging by the proliferation of heavy weaponry and other lethal arms that have made it into the hands of al Qaeda in Syria (al Nusra Front), ISIS, Jaysh al Islam and others   it s clear that Uncle Sam s generous donation of $500 million has definitely been used to equip, if not train, those  rebels  in Syria.Middle East commentator and analyst Sharmine Narwani explains the West s perennial dilemma when trying to identify who their  moderates  are in Syria: For years, Washington has insisted there are armed  moderate  groups in Syria, but have gone to great lengths to avoid naming these  moderates.  Why? Because if moderates were named and identified, the US would have to be very, very certain that no past, present or future  atrocity video  would surface to prove otherwise. And the US could not guarantee this with any of the groups they have armed, trained or financed in Syria over the past five years. The next  train and equip  round will be more focused, and will be used to secure the following  The map above is from July 2015, but still represents the current military chessboard in Syria.Safe Zone =  Sunnistan Somehow it feels like 1998 all over again, with bad memories of the KLA in Kosovo, imported jihadist fighters in Bosnia, and NATO lording over a newly balkanized region.When you hear US officials like John McCain or clueless Republican presidential candidates like Marco Rubio or Carly Fiorina, all crowing for a  Safe Zone  in northern Syria, this is what they are referring to (see map above). Their  safe zone  just so happens to be in the exact same area where ISIS is currently holding court. It s a  safe zone  alright, but not for refugees and  Syrians fleeing the evil Bashar al Assad    rather, the  safe zone  will be for an array of  rebel  and terrorist fighters, part of a defacto Sunni state-lette in waiting.So the US-led Coalition s  safe zone  is the very Caliphate that Americans are decrying.For anyone requiring proof that such a grand chessboard is in play in Syria, they need look no further than a set of US airstrikes that took place before Christmas. On December 6, 2015,  US fighter bombers struck a Syrian military base located in the village of Ayyash in Deir Ezzor Province, east of Raqqa, which killed 3 Syrian Arab Army (SAA) soldiers and wounded additional others. Naturally, the Pentagon swiftly denied that any such attack took place. What happened after this incident was extremely telling, as explained by global affairs analyst Mike Whitney from Counterpunch Magazine: It s also worth noting, that according to South Front military analysis, the US bombing raid coincided with a  a full-scale ISIS offensive on the villages of Ayyash and Bgelia.  In other words, the US attack provided sufficient air-cover for ISIS terrorists to carry out their ground operations. Was that part of the plan or was it merely a coincidence? So the US air force was coordinating with ISIS boots on the ground, to achieve a common military objective. But it didn t end there. Less than 24 hours after the attack, US warplanes bombed the village of Al-Khan in north-eastern Syria killing 26 Syrian civilians including at least four women and seven children and four women. The message the US military is sending with these lethal attacks is that it wants to control the air-space over east Syria where it plans to remove ISIS and establish a de facto Sunni state consistent with its scheme to break Syria and Iraq into smaller cantons governed by local warlords, Islamic fanatics, and US puppets. Also taking place at the same moment on Dec 6th, was Turkey s quiet little invasion into northern Iraq, sending hundreds of troops and at least 20 tanks into territory north of Mosul, right between the Kurds and ISIS. It should be noted that this illegal incursion by NATO member Turkey was not approved by the Iraqi government in Baghdad, and Iraqi PM Haider al-Abadi called for Turkey to  immediately withdraw its troops.  Judging by Washington s silence on the matter, it s obvious that the US gave Turkey its full blessing. Here, Zero Hedge astutely points out the obvious: Most importantly of all, right on what Al-Araby al-Jadeed claims is the smuggling route for illegal ISIS crude into Turkey from Iraq.  Not surprisingly, Turkey s sudden move also came at the same time that Russia began to publicly expose Turkey s clandestine role in facilitating the ISIS oil trade, as well as launching airstrikes to destroy ISIS oil convoys moving from Syria into Turkey. And then Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdo an (photo, left) places his military assets at the very location where stolen ISIS oil makes its way from Iraq into Turkey? Hardly a coincidence.Make no mistake, both ends of NATO s military axle, the United States and Turkey, along with their Saudi-backed boots on the ground in ISIS and al Nusra   have each made critical strategic moves in unison, and with a specific military purpose each time, nudging towards securing territory. Once each key piece is finally in position, all that is required is a new  crisis , either in the region, or in Europe, or in America   to allow the Axis powers to move in quickly and take what is needed to implement the next phase of the game, whether that s creating a Kurdish canton, or a Sunni state-lette. Such moves will rarely be covered by the western international media.To be perfectly clear, the terms  Sunni  and  Shia  are the favored sectarian lexicon used by Nation Builders Inc and its international partners in Riyadh and Tel Aviv. My intention here is not to reduce the Muslim world down to this paradigm, but the architects of instability will use these terms, over and over   in their attempt to both marginalize and dehumanized Muslims for their own selfish ends.What s the  safe zone  for? As the US-led Coalition steps up its 18 month-long Punch  n Judy air operation to supplant ISIS from Raqqa, those western-backed jihadis will later require a safe corridor to flee but still remain connected to their Turkish supply lines. Washington s  safe zone  would also provide a much-needed safe haven for  rebels  who have been sent packing by the Syrian government from towns like Homs and others, as part of a painstaking disarming and reconciliation process between the Assad government and  opposition  rebels who are willing to participate in the program. Once the NATO-GCC Axis has established a mini protectorate inside of Syria, this will provide everything ISIS, al Nusra, Ahrar al-Sham, Turkmens et all will need; a secure launching pad for incursions further inside Syria   which will certainly guarantee a longer, protracted conflict in Syria   and beyond.This little Sunni wedge is also conveniently located next to a large rebel-terrorist contingent in Syria s northwestern Idlib governorate (province). Syria s border with Turkey has been porous from the beginning of the conflict, so the proposed  safe zone  will allow Turkey to maintain this status quo   where it has been continuously allowing the free-flow of weapons, rebels and terrorist fighters alike, along with oil, narcotics and human trafficking   to move freely through its southern border with Syria.If  regime  change  rhetoric is anything to go by, along with turning a blind eye to NATO member Turkey s role in facilitating supply lines and safe passage for al Qaeda and ISIS, then Washington s agenda is fairly transparent here. If they can establish a  internationally recognized  safe zone and a No-Fly Zone on top of it, central planners believe they will have the platform they need to eventually destroy Damascus, install their own western puppet, and then carve up Syria and northern Iraq accordingly. ISIS RAT-LINES: Black market oil has been a key component to carrying on both conflicts in Syria, and Iraq.For the architects of instability in Washington, one crucial benefit of carving out Sunni territory in both northern and eastern Syria is that available oil will help fund all of their paramilitary and terrorist needs   making it sustainable. To guarantee this uninterrupted income stream from black market oil which is presently making its way out of Syria and into Turkey and via Kurdistan, help is required from the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) and other stakeholders, including the British-Turkish firm Genel Energy, just one firm who is providing the end-run to market for illicit ISIS oil. Ditto for a key mover and shaker in Raqqa s new Rockefeller class, Bilal Erdogan, the son of Turkish president, who according to numerous recent reports has already amassed a small fortune from the lucrative oil-for-terror trade.This is a problem, but one which Washington, London and Paris are not overly concerned with, much less upset about. Iraqi, Kurdish and Turkish opposition officials have accused Turkish governments and the KRG of deliberately allowing some of these smuggling operations to take place.Even as provisional state-lettes and cantons are conjured around it, there is no guarantee that Greater Kurdistan will ever see the light of day if Nation Builders Inc having anything to say bout it. The promise of Greater Kurdistan is as important to neocolonialists, than the reality of a Greater Kurdistan. Turkey also has its own interests and ambitions, and a Greater Kurdistan is not compatible with them. Iraq is not crazy about the idea either, because of obvious financial and energy resource reasons. So they remain in limb indefinitely, even as smaller quasi-Kurdish entities sprout up around the KRG. Turkey has its own ongoing  Kurdish problem  within Turkish borders, so Ankara will naturally view any expressions of Kurdish autonomy around it as a threat and potential inspiration for international Kurdish solidarity. Ruling over the Kurds means keeping them divided, and playing them off against their neighbors.There are those within the Turkish establishment who believe there are old scores still unsettled   in reclaiming Turk territory in both Syria and Iraq.SEE ALSO: SPECIAL REPORT: ISIS Oil? Follow the Money (Back to Europe)Here is where Sunnistan proper can emerge, coming into its own once set pieces are in place in Iraq and across Kurdistan, as Mike Whitney explained: So it looks like an agreement has been struck between Turkey, the KRG and the United States to seize parts of northern Iraq and eastern Syria to create a de facto Sunni state that will be jointly-controlled by Ankara and Washington.  It also looks like Obama has agreed to use dodgy jihadi-proxies (aka Terrorists) to work alongside US Special Forces to carry out future military operations.  So while the effort to remove Assad has been temporarily put on the backburner, the determination to destroy Syria is as strong as ever.  Another dismembered part of old Syria and Iraq which central planners are hoping to hack-off is an area called Rojava (see map above), or  Western Kurdistan . This region in northern Syria, formerly known as Syrian Kurdistan, gained its autonomy in November 2013 as part of the ongoing Rojava Revolution. The Kurdish defense forces here are known as the YPG (People s Defense Units) and are not on friendly footing with neighboring Turkey, for a number of reasons, not least of all because YPG defense forces present resistance to both al Nusra and ISIS encroachments into all three Rojava cantons. For Turkey, this is bad for business. How Rojava will factor into Washington s plans is not clear yet, but it occupies the most strategic squares on the chessboard.Make no mistake, the history s actors are all in for this plan. Do not be fooled by talk of  peace and stability  or humanitarian platitudes from western leaders, the UN, or the fair weather international community.Another indication that these plans have the full backing of the neoconservative illiterati, and Israel too, was PNAC walrus and former US Ambassador to the UN John Bolton s recent article in the establishment s daily journal of political posterity, the New York Times, where he states: Today s reality is that Iraq and Syria as we have known them are gone. The Islamic State has carved out a new entity from the post-Ottoman Empire settlement, mobilizing Sunni opposition to the regime of President Bashar al-Assad and the Iran-dominated government of Iraq. Also emerging, after years of effort, is a de facto independent Kurdistan. Central planners will happily frame this geopolitical scenario within the preferred theme of Sunni vs Shia  sectarian strife  in the region, which just happens to suit the interests and desires of both Saudi Arabia and Israel. Bolton confirms this: If, in this context, defeating the Islamic State means restoring to power Mr. Assad in Syria and Iran s puppets in Iraq, that outcome is neither feasible nor desirable. Rather than striving to recreate the post-World War I map, Washington should recognize the new geopolitics. The best alternative to the Islamic State in northeastern Syria and western Iraq is a new, independent Sunni state. Not so fast Mr. Ambassador. The Islamic State is the Sunni State.So for all intents and purposes, he s calling for the establishment of the Caliphate (funny how this goes right over the heads of  conservatives ). This is just one of many geostrategic moves which will guarantee instability and military conflict in the region for another 100 years, as well as provide a timely entr e through to Azerbaijan and into Iran, and later towards the Eurasian heartland of Dagestan (Russia s emerging energy center and geographic underbelly).In the meantime, expect to be pelted with endless propaganda about starving children in one town or another, changing week to week   with the usual slogans like,  we must act now! , and blaming Bashar al Assad for the suffering of his people. It s already wearing thin.Until the US and its NATO-GCC Axis stops flooding Syria and the region with weapons and terrorist fighters, and continues its policy of toppling secular nation-states   then any attempt at holding peace talks will end up back at square one, and stand as another exercise in futility.If the Syrian conflict has been good for one thing (and that s not to say it has), it s that the scripted western narrative, in all of its variations, has finally hit the wall of truth.***Author Patrick Henningsen is a writer, lecturer and global affairs analyst for international TV and radio.

In fact, US Military Central Command (CENTCOM) for the Middle East region is located in Qatar s capital of Doha, conveniently located just down the road from Al Jazeera s headquarters. Nice and cozy.Al Jazeera s role in promoting  regime change  and the destablization of Syria is now recorded history, as are its many shameful exhibitions of media fakery.The Qatari royals tried to expand propaganda operations into North America, but no matter how much money they threw at it (and those royals just love throwing money at things to try and get them to work), no one cared about it, much less watched it.

Wait, it gets worse MONEY FOR NOTHING: Gore got fat off the AJAM deal.In addition to the $500 million which Doha blew on buying Gore s lemon, Current TV, the Qataris have spent at least $50 million per year between 2012   2015, along with many millions spent on advertising AJAM on other network slots, online ads, along with billboards and print media promotions. This was the Qataris   easy  ticket on to US cable and satellite networks. Boy, did Gore pull a fast one there.  In total, you would be looking at $700 million for the whole party. At its apex, AJAM would be lucky to pull in 30,000 viewers during prime time   which really amounts to a  nothing  market share.With all that money, and considering the hundreds of staff and  media executives  and producers they employed, it s safe to say that someone(s) did not have a clue what they were doing.What a colossal joke.On the bright side, the Qataris can always blame the collapse in oil prices for their lack of spare cash to fund their propaganda mills.READ MORE MAINSTREAM MEDIA EPIC FAILS AT: 21st Century Wire MSM Watch",Middle-east,"January 14, 2016",Fake
